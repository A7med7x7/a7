After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.\nOne day, I visited him at home and saw him packing up his bags, and some of his luggage was already packed. I was slightly irritated. he was so happy about his future, and I was happy for him too. Two years ago, I remember watching a video he shot that day, looking at myself, I could see how drowned I was in my thoughts, completely silent. Not many days passed before he booked his flight tickets.\nI went to the airport feeling completely numb . I even remember that my sister drove me, although I insisted on riding alone. I tried to make sure his journey went smoothly, helped him with the procedures, and it wasn’t long before I saw him hugging his family. That day, I didn’t grieve silently; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold myself. When he came to hug me one last time, I cried like a child. It was the most terrible feeling I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn’t stop myself from crying. I cried the entire way back home, at home, and again the next morning.\nFor the first time, my feelings rushed without control, without regulation, without avoidance; I got to see how vulnerable I was. With everything I had repressed before, the very distinct thought in my head was translated as: “I don’t know what to do with my life anymore.” It felt like I had lost myself. It felt like there was an important definition in my life that was suddenly gone. Even though the tears subside, writing this was never easy. I’ve tried to interpret what happened that day many times before, but most of the time I avoided thinking about it. Even now, while writing this, remembering it makes me cry like a child.\nThe days after he left were empty. I felt depressed and had no motivation to do anything. This eventually developed into severe social anxiety . I dragged myself into a cycle of illnesses and panic attacks that didn’t stop.\nFor almost four years, I hid my pain from him, how the days felt when he wasn’t around. I focused on how happy he seemed exploring a new world. I wanted to match his happy feelings, but two months ago, during a FaceTime call, the conversation suddenly shifted to the day he left. I was triggered and cried like a child again. I had never healed from the emotions I kept avoiding; they were always there, repressed.\nit was a goodbye I never recovered from, that particular departure triggered years of anxiety I was subconsciously avoiding by keeping myself busy, I miss you more than you can imagine, my friend. Not having you around was the hardest thing I ever had to go through.\n","title":"The Moment I Realized What He Meant to Me","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-moment-i-realized-what-he-meant-to-me/"},{"content":" your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.\nIt’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.\nAvoidant attachment is a pattern where you feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness and tend to pull away or shut down when relationships start to feel too vulnerable. Deep down, you may still want connection, but it feels safer to stay distant, guarded, or independent.\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of this term “Avoidant attachment,” and it is crazy how accurately it sums up and explains the recurrence of my patterns, Adding new friends systems , Elaborate Adding new friends system On avoidant attachment after watching videos about this topic, I felt it’s relevant to what I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing, and I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how mature psychology is, to the point of describing such a phenomenon. Below I will paste a comprehensive summary that can help understand the avoidant personality in a nutshell, and build on top of its light.\nYour avoidant isn\u0026rsquo;t fine, they\u0026rsquo;re just numb, to you it registers as indifference, what if they\u0026rsquo;re gone, what if they\u0026rsquo;re done, what if they\u0026rsquo;re over this, but internally on their part, it is an emotional shutdown. Avoidant don\u0026rsquo;t walk away calm, they walk away frozen, they don\u0026rsquo;t process in the moment, they don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened. They retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection. They are avoiding the emotional bill that just hasn\u0026rsquo;t hit them yet, because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them early, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them after a day or after a week, it hits them later on. When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone, and when they think that you have stopped expecting anything from them, that is the moment that it hits them. That\u0026rsquo;s when they start remembering the moment that they hurt you. And that\u0026rsquo;s when they finally feel what you felt in real time.\nThis piece is the first to encounter when searching for what this term means. I find it very accurate to the point I feel discomfort that there is someone out there is able to describe me in words, to have the words and explanation that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have, that I was searching for almost my entire life. I can see my own patterns here, by distilling this piece:\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened This explains the selective ignorance that I adapt\nthey retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection, this explains many of my disappearances because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame, all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you,this explains my writing state of numbness When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone; this explains why I avoided establishing direct relationship (closeness), and decided to use society buckets On the harm I caused others For a long time I believed I\u0026rsquo;m just not build for relationships, the moment someone brings emotions to our conversation I pull away, there is this poor Jonior whom I met recently and the moment he told me: “you\u0026rsquo;re cool, I like you, we could be friends”,As soon as he said that, I completely withdrew. and vanished from his life. Earlier this year I was talking to my friend Omer Monir. on how I’ve abundant the idea of romantic relationships in my life. Due to reasons I failed to interpret at the time, but the idea of I myself avoiding it, is a huge factor. What scares me the most about all sorts of relationships is the closeness and the commitment it brings, I can\u0026rsquo;t show up everyday, I\u0026rsquo;m terrified and not familiar with the intimacy that comes with establishing relationships, I run, I pull away and I shut down emotionally the moment these start to happen,\nthis explains why I freaked out when recently one of the uni colleagues told me I\u0026rsquo;m their best friend, I froze, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what did I respond with, he was so polite when he added the words “but I understand that you\u0026rsquo;re always busy and you don\u0026rsquo;t text too much, but I know that you\u0026rsquo;re a good man”, I was left speechless, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t say a word, I felt the guilt of how I\u0026rsquo;m not able to love them back the way they loved me. but at the end a person will only love you to the capacity in which they\u0026rsquo;re able to love themselves. I\u0026rsquo;ve failed many people before; they were victims of my avoidance, This dialogue helps me to imagine the kind of stress I put those people under.\nI\u0026rsquo;m being too much, the replies are getting colder, shorter, it\u0026rsquo;s like they don\u0026rsquo;t even care at all anymore, now I\u0026rsquo;m starting to freak out, because the only person I wanna talk to, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m interrupting them or I\u0026rsquo;m disturbing them, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m a burden, like I\u0026rsquo;m unwelcomed. Did I do something wrong, am I pushing them away, because they are not giving me the same energy that they did, I just want them to notice, I just want them to remind me that I matter to them.\nI once wrote how I\u0026rsquo;m really not good at putting myself in the other people shoes , and how I fooled myself into thinking people won’t be affected by my own patterns but in reality, I have hurt people, a lot of them, and I keep hurting more, by avoiding them, by showing up randomly and disappear frequently. It’s a strange grief to realize the amount of wounded people not out of cruelty I exposed, but out of an instinct, a second nature I caught before I ever had the words for it. The grief is even harder to bear when thinking that some people didn’t walk away from me; they walked away from the waiting. From my patterns. I only learned the cost after the silence became permanent.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful that the things I wrote in the past are finally becoming clear to me. A lot of friends helped to see this part of myself, how avoidant I am, including my best friend AbdAlwahab, and a bunch of victims. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this to result in a behaviour change soon, but at least for now, I can recognize my own patterns. At least for now, everything made sense.\n","title":"Learning the Truth About How I Love","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/a_grief_i_didnt_expect/"},{"content":"This piece of writing was part of an article I’m writing, about how I would help someone answering the question of “what do I want to do”, where I discuss how to pick a major and what helps you to define the way you contribute to this world. I found the draft of the article to be very lengthy, I may expected the reader to be aware of difference notions upfront, so I preferred this topic to be referenced here. As many of my drafts are pointing to it.\nIntro I started by highlighting how chasing long horizon questions can lead to unnecessary complexity that you might not have the tooling to unpack currently\nIt is not in your interest to waste time on investigating how the educational system started and why I need to get a degree in the first place, but rather to admit and sign up to the terms and conditions of this life. It is in your interest to know how to make the best use of your free will, if it was not, by your parents or conditions, to choose what you want to do in life. That might, but not necessarily result in your enrollment in a related field at the university, considering a topic as your side hustle or ultimately your profession, more on this later.\nConsent to the game rules is what I love to call accepting how the systems work, and agreeing to the terms and conditions that are dictated by our modern societies and cultures. What I will count as an example is the generalist/polymath who would argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to pick a major, or they want to consume more than one major; this can result in abandoning the educational system or not taking it seriously. I will consume all arts and sciences until the line drawing these distinctions diminish, they say. Although this is a bold claim that no one dares to hold, people underestimate the amount of discipline they need to maintain in order to achieve what their perception wove.\nI always think of the American Constitution promoting the amendments about the division of labor that, in order for the nation/community to grow and help optimize the metrics for its greater good, economics, innovation, fast food, and the good things we have in our modern societies. People should be specialists.\nthis is more of a reality check that defines the way the world functions, if happens and you are one of those people buying the idea of being a generalist, I\u0026rsquo;m not telling you to drop the idea, but most importantly telling you you\u0026rsquo;re swimming against the odds by being a generalist, and that you need to make sure your good plan of becoming a generalist helps you and ultimately us in providing something meaningful to the world and it is not a recursion. not just illusions of being special. Although someone might argue that the future belongs to those who combine different skills, for now, this is an example of resistance in consenting to the game rules.\nConsenting to the game requires being able to make sense of why the world is the way it is, and to be ready to take off all the chains holding you back from starting to contribute to the world, wether this is despair of how much evil exists in the world, or confusion of how disorder the systems are, skepticism because if any of this real, or if my doings matter, these questions regarding the game of life need to be answered to finally consent with a rested heart after all the searching to the game rules.\nbut as you can see, most of these questions are philosophical, they are about meaning, existence, identity, things that you will naturally experience the moment you you\u0026rsquo;re conscious, others might require you to explore politics and economics, what you need to do is simple, to just believe in the idea of making tomorrow a better day, to Reduce your suffering. because this will help you in the pursuit of existential clarity, and will yield you will stamina to purse answers in different directions, this worth a standalone article but the gist of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying is, if you want to find answers to the questions you are having, you need to be good with whatever will serve you in making tomorrow a better day, the same way you are good with the language, out of its importance in describing the universe, you need to be good and welcome with the things that will minimize the complexity of your situations, having an initial faith you will be facing the game rules (The nonsense you don\u0026rsquo;t understand) and use it as instrument for better you. if this might still abstract I might indeed to write a standalone point.\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t be thriving and winning unless you stand and consent to the game rules. Staying the same and doing nothing will only make it worst, so we pick what is less painful; to get up and find answers, to contribute to humanity with what we will find.\nFinding Answers Some of these questions you need to answer in order to consent willingly to the game rules can take years, and this is definitely not the best case scenario, especially in your case, where you want more answers to forecast accurately. However, the best case scenario is to have the ability to be selectively ignorant,\nSelectively Ignorant If you can classify these kinda of questions that will drag you into an infinite loop, it is better to carry on your work by ignoring these questions and having their burden in the background, in the hope that they will be answered one day. This will help minimize the complexity of your decision-making. Selective ignorance is applied in different parts of my life; maybe I will write more about it in the future.\nThat Will do My second advice is not to overthink whether the answers you\u0026rsquo;ve got are optimal, or if it\u0026rsquo;s an answer that made you feel good. If it fits and helps you in the process of getting closer to start consenting to the game rules, then use them as placeholders. The unveiled insights and joy of consenting to the game are more rewarding than the value of time wasted searching for the optimal. Do not care about the sources, it can come from something minor as a random quoted message you read on some random street walls written by a heartbroken lover, that you will consider as the last piece of the puzzle, TEDx talk, discussion with a friend. university course, whether your sources were science, religion. Whatever will do. do not change a word\n","title":"Consenting to the Game Rules","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/consenting_to_the_game_rules/"},{"content":" Sister Calderon: I don\u0026rsquo;t know but..whenever we happen to meet you\u0026rsquo;re always helping people and smiling.\nArthur: You\u0026rsquo;re too smart for me sister..I guess I..I\u0026rsquo;m afraid.\nSister Calderon: There is nothing to be afraid of mister Morgan.

I hesitated to make new friendships , I hesitated to share my writings publicly .\nThe reason is I was, and to this very day concerned with the questions that deviated me from being socially active. One of these questions is:\nWhat happens to a young person’s expectations about life when most of what they see one the internet are idealized stories, overly wise, unrealistic narratives? What happens to my community if this is the kind of discussion being shared publicly, which is mostly unproductive, pointless, trivial, and hollow? Can I change this?\nI\u0026rsquo;m still young, actively consuming data from the world, learning, and constantly changing. Sharing my opinions is not making the world a better place, I\u0026rsquo;m sure whatever I write be deprecated by my constantly evolving beliefs . so why bother writing? the world has enough of people talking, saying they want to make it a better place. The world is full of people who are more \u0026ldquo;qualified\u0026rdquo; to talk than myself although no one listens to them. Writing random quotes on social media that can mean different things to different people, or sharing a meme that can help someone heal, was enough for me.\nThis hides the part of my life I don\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable revealing in lengthy stories and lessons. The problem is that the majority of people end up using social media as a self help book. They look up to people\u0026rsquo;s achievements to get inspired, craving stories that match their personal circumstances and challenges. People are subconsciously building a map about the world using what is shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X…\nAn example: someone doubting their journey in learning finance، feeling lost in the equations, thinking they’re \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo; because everyone else seems to master the math effortlessly and even automate process in software tools. What people don’t say is that doubt is normal, and many of these equations aren’t intuitive at all, hardly understood at any given time. and It’s okay to feel confused Another example . someone just learning software engineering opens LinkedIn and feels left behind because people post about how they can solve noble problems using data science and machine learning software 2.0 they say. They may feel others are more impactful, and build the statement \u0026ldquo;all people working in data science are impactful\u0026rdquo; while in reality, most of these are demo projects, graduation projects, or research ideas far from implementation. I experienced the same when I first accessed the internet, consuming materials that seemed ideal, perfect, true, valid ,but are far from reality.\nNot explicitly mentioning our imperfections, hiding them, does not help. Packaging them in memes, stories, or art might provide temporary comfort and company for someone receiving, but it might not be good in the long run. I see this as one of the factors contributing to people\u0026rsquo;s despair these days. We tend to package our social appearance with what we find worth showing. Of course, you won\u0026rsquo;t go out there showing people all the insecurities you have. Telling them how you overcome social anxiety, they believe its a myth, or how awkward your hobbies are, you will be judged harshly. A few people do this. But in searching for perfection, we forget the most natural attributes of being human: being present , being emotional, being wrong.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m about to talk publicly or post on social media, I overthink if my writing matches all backgrounds and ages of my audience, if people would think I\u0026rsquo;m insecure about something, and if my writing is solid. That\u0026rsquo;s why I mostly write short quotes, not sharing experiences, lessons, or opinions, and ultimately suppressing my emotions.\nLife isn’t a set of solutions Life isn\u0026rsquo;t made up of a set of solutions for you to find.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built on extreme behaviors you learn to balance.\nAs a result of not engaging fully socially I have mastered controlling and potentially suppressing my emotions; which led to numbness . eventually I lost the meaning and pleasure of sharing my experience. the silence of surviving a day that no one knew about was hard, but the comfort zone I build covered this. Other factors include I\u0026rsquo;m very good at keeping myself busy and having master\u0026rsquo;s degree in wearing custom masks. By letting myself speak more honestly, I’m not only helping myself grow; I’m giving something back to the people who read me. If I share things as they are not polished, not idealized I might open a small space for someone else to breathe, to doubt safely, to feel normal again. And maybe this is how I contribute: not by being perfect, but by being real when most people aren’t.\nNow, I need to learn the opposite: I need to engage, to care. I need to feel and to love. To enhance the quality of my life, I must show my true colors without abandoning myself.\nI must stop wearing masks and let the changes that happen to me show up in my behavior with people. This way I can know who truly loves me and whose concerns include my problems.\nPerfect time does not exist if you wait, until everything feels finished, you gonna miss the people who would have loved you exactly as you are.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve waited for a long time to get it right, to feel certain that I finally figured it all out. That I will have a good map of reality which can define ideal human interactions for me. But this never happened, and I might waste my life waiting. And planning.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give this a shot I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to read books, rush the process of writing and publicly sharing, spend hours consulting friends, and form smaller communities to test my ideas. Did they work? Not entirely, but they provided lessons and information. I have no clue if this is just one of those random 3:00 AM bursts of motivation or if I’m finally tired of my own patterns, but one thing is sure: life rewards actions more than intelligence. I have a preliminary outline of what I want to do, and I should not overthink and drown myself in inaction. I will fail, it\u0026rsquo;s okay. I\u0026rsquo;m freaking out while writing this, but the signs point me to try. I will share more because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. Sharing my uncertainty can help someone; sharing my doubts when learning something can make someone\u0026rsquo;s day better. Sharing my insecurities can bring me people who help me overcome them.\nIn the end Having these pieces of notions connected and understood took me a long time. Yesterday, I was vulnerable, unaware of what I write here. My writing is not perfect; I could have used wiser words. Blind spots, potential mistakes, and pitfalls await me, but I welcome them, and I welcome whoever helps me in my journey.\nFor what is a man what has he got If not himself then he has not To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way.\n","title":"Learning to Feel Again","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/learning_to_feel_again/"},{"content":"I had a friend I met online who struggled with social anxiety. He used to tell me how he panicked at the idea of going to the university. I knew he wasn’t lying, but part of me couldn’t truly believe it, that a psychological disorder could control someone that much. I was telling him: you just needed to stop overthinking that people will hurt you, remind yourself there’s no reason to be afraid, and call it a day. Yes, I was ignorant. I tried to convince him to change something he couldn’t change, to “overcome it,” as if these were only voices in his head.\nIn 2022, I joined the University of Khartoum. I enjoyed the first few weeks before I flew out of the country and returned only for the first semester exam. like any freshman, I spent that first year in exploration, even though I was mostly abroad and only came back for exams and a few short periods.I was just given access to all sorts of materials. I just got good at googling things, MIT lectures, practical sessions, philosophy, logic, debates, activities. I wasn’t extreme/insane compared to people who signed up for every program and consumed whatever their eyes landed on, but I was selectively adding to my curiosity bucket, which happened to be very large. At that time, I was a firm believer in “having the skills” rather than just scanning books, which of course didn’t make me a healthy intellectual out of me, not the kind with good habits and healthy shape. No, it did quite the opposite. It put my health at risk.\nI had early signs that something bad was about to happen. I even mentioned this to my friend Kenyata , telling him how much I lack entertainment and simple enjoyment in my life. I was in Morocco at the time, I told him that when I return back to Sudan, I wanted to explore life a bit, pause from the grind, and see what people did outside academics and work. I told him I planned to try different restaurants. And honestly the reason I wanted to have a pause was that, my brother had been asking about my social life. He somehow convinced me it was important for my health to go outside, socialize and meet some friends. I took his advice seriously because he’s an introvert like me, and I hoped that piece of wisdom came from his own experience. But when I came back, I overloaded myself with even more tasks. I consumed even more material, aggressively. The social promise I made to my brother vanished, and I completely forgot the need to entertain myself.\nI remember that day clearly, the night before was long I spend the whole night awake and went into the exam without any rest, it was a calculus exam so you can imagine the amount of preparation I needed to put. after the exam, I went to the Computer Science department building at the faculty (the one basically colonized by IT students) for a reason I can’t even remember. I was somewhere in the middle of the first staircase. and without any premises I felt I was dying.\nI experienced a tunnel vision , I felt I was isolated from the world, My heart started beating so fast for no reason, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel normal at all. I was shocked to the point I could barely breath, I was lucky that the stairs had a handrail I can hold onto, I slowly made my way to the building\u0026rsquo;s entrance, where some seniors noticed there is something wrong with me, I\u0026rsquo;ve asked them to bring me water and mango juice (Maza) for some reason, maybe I thought it was a sugar problem. I was carried to what I think was the network admins office or something similar where I rested but my heart couldn\u0026rsquo;t slow down. Thankfully a girl from my batch called Esraa saw me and stood stayed with me stood by since,\nI was taken to the hospital, where they put all those sensors to my chest and ran different scans and tests. After about half an hour of that relentless, heavy heartbeat, my heart finally slowed down. I expected nothing less than a stroke or some kind of heart condition. I even had this dramatic thoughts that I might die from heartbreak for reasons I had woven in my head. I thought, This must be it.\nSurprisingly, all the scans were clean. I remember the doctor telling me my heart was “like a horse’s heart,” and that I didn’t have any heart disease. Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the horse\u0026rsquo;s heart analogy I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less, but It was a relief, although I was too mentally overwhelmed to process anything. I never followed up with the doctors to understand exactly what happened. My family arrived and took me home. My sister Zeinab, who is a doctor, told me it was a panic attack and explained what that meant. I watched some videos about it including this TEDx video I remember clearly, and I immediately related to it. I also joined online support groups and found comfort in hearing other people’s stories.\nI was healing from this accident by listening to the stories of people who experienced the same thing. Knowing that others had gone through similar circumstances that I wasn’t alone was reasonable to me to relief. But I never looked into why I was triggered in the first other than knowing “stress can lead you here, and it will reoccur when you trigger it again.”\nI eventually noticed a pattern: I felt discomfort whenever I was at the university. I remember this day very distinctly where I wanted any excuse not to go there. And luckily for me, the car I used to drive had almost no gas, and I wasn’t planning to stand in a long fuel queue. For but for some reason, though, I decided to go using public transportation, first a city train, then a bus. While crossing the bridge, Kobry Alhadeed, I started getting anxious. I felt afraid. And the closer I got to the university, the more scared I became. I can’t remember the lectures from that day, but it was the day I confirmed the pattern.\nWhat shocked me was what happened after the lectures. A friend told me he wanted to pick something up from the Computer Science department building and asked me to walk with him before we return back home.I found myself standing in front of the entrance, and my stress levels were extreme. I couldn’t enter the building. That’s when I knew: this was the thing I feared. I was afraid that if I entered that building again, something would happen to me.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the building is officially the “CS Department,” but it’s mostly used for IT lectures. Since I’m a computer science student, I was never required to be there, I had no courses inside that building. But I used to go there anyway because many of our friends had lectures there and were always hanging out. What I didn’t realize is that I had been avoiding it the entire time without noticing. I didn’t enter that building again until the course finished.\nWriting this now triggered me a bit. It seems that building really freak me out the most. While I was fighting these internal battles with panic attacks, the symptoms started to manifest as IBS. I thought it was genetic, most of my family has it, but my sister told me mine was caused by stress, and because you were very stressed recently, the IBS decided to accompany you. And she was right, the conversations I had with Kenyata about pausing the grind, was because a very subtle, inner voice was whispering to me, you need to take rest, but because I was exploring and the dopamine was always high, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t notice that I was under stress, stress that I love doing, stress out of things I loved, I later learned that even the things you love can make you sick, but it was too late. I noticed I only experienced the symptoms when I was stressed, not when I ate garbage food.\nDuring that period, a sudden shift hit my social life, it changed suddenly. I couldn’t hold conversations longer than a minute. I avoided people, especially the ones I knew well. I felt that if I talked too much, I would die. And I mean that literally, that’s how it felt. Talking to people I knew became the scariest thing ever. Almost everyone in my batch noticed. “Ahmed has changed.” Some even sat with me and asked what was going on. I’m not sure what I told them, but I’m sure I said something like, “everything is fine”, because I had no words to describe what I was going through.\nAnd suddenly, I had social anxiety. Me? Ahmed? the guy who initiated our batch group chat, who was nominated to be the batch representative, who used to be public and comfortable speaking. I wasn’t afraid of people. And now I had social anxiety? It was hard to believe. It was a dramatic shift. My online friend the one I used to make fun of when he told me he had social anxiety, I was slowly beginning to understand him, and to understand how ignorant I had been. I never imagined a day would come when my thoughts would no longer control my body.\nI was skeptical. I made several assumptions to explain what I was experiencing. The first was returning to the idea that I actually had a heart disease, because all the discomfort was happening in my chest and around my heart. The second was that I might be bewitched or cursed somehow. And the third was that it was a punishment from God, because I had once thought my friend was exaggerating his condition, and making things up. Between those assumptions, I was lost. I genuinely didn’t know what was happening to me.\nA new fear was unlocked during that time. where I went to picnic and I met some friends some of them for the first time, it is common in Sudan, we greeted each other with hugs, before handshakes. I remember seeing the first group of friends, and before we even hugged, my body was signaling that I should run, that I shouldn’t let anyone touch me. I\u0026rsquo;m someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like physical interactions, but not to the point of being terrified of it. I didn’t want this. I forced myself to hug them “normally”, and of course I didn’t die, but my stress levels was even higher than when I stood in front of the CS department building. At that moment, I believed for sure that I was bewitched. There was no way, that someone can get stressed and feel like they might die from hugging a friend, someone I should have been happy to see.\nAfter about two hours, another group of friends arrived, and when it came time for the hugging thing again, I partially fainted and fell to the ground. My friend Mustafa sensed my heartbeat; it was beating to the max. I don’t remember the exact dialogue, but they gave me something to drink and eat. And then I was fine again. They were confused because my explanations weren\u0026rsquo;t clear; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear to me either.\nI don’t remember a lot from that period because too many things were happening at once. But I do remember that after that picnic, I stopped meeting people entirely. I skipped university for several days. And it wasn’t long after that when the war started. To this day, I still can’t fully understand why all of this happened. But at least I evaluated my assumptions: I have came to the realization I wasn’t bewitched. After about eight months, I went back to working out and running, and being able to do those things easily, without any heart issues, boosted my confidence that I didn’t have a heart disease.\nI was gradually disappearing from people\u0026rsquo;s life, I had no motivation to talk to people, I have more things that are telling me not to connect with people, I mean if just hugs are doing this to do. lol, Looking back, I see many people who have no explanation for why I disappeared from their lives, why my behavior changed so drastically. Things weren’t good even before the war they were getting worse, but at least they eventually led me to understand that stress was the cause, even when I couldn’t feel the stress itself. One of the strange, almost funny stories from that time: several weeks after the incident, the right side of my face became completely paralyzed. I couldn’t move it at all. I went to the hospital, they diagnosed me with Bell’s palsy , a condition where the facial nerve on one side of the face suddenly stops working. And of course I was bewitched, of all the diseases that I know, I was given a weird paralysis in the face, someone must have wanted to torture me. After reading more about it, I learned that stress can also cause it. I rested my heart by saying, Stress is the cause.\nI remember I landed an internship but only went onsite for a total of three days. I remember barely speaking to my best friends during that entire period. I don’t remember much about how things were at home either, but I’m sure I kept myself constantly busy. Those days affected almost every part of my life. I tend to have a weaker memory for the bad times, but what I’ve written here are the extremes, the moments I simply couldn’t forget. The belief that I always had control over my mind and my body, that I can act as a commander was a heaven that I only realized when I lost control, when my mind and body turned against me. I was afraid that people would see me as vulnerable, I was afraid that with all this stress adding more and more complexity to my life, that I would be dependent on someone, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be burden. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to know that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ok.\n","title":"Days That I Don’t Understand","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/days_that_i_didnt_understand/"},{"content":"The velocity at which I\u0026rsquo;m updating my beliefs about the world has never been known to be slow; saying \u0026ldquo;Oops\u0026rdquo; and updating my beliefs implies updating my behavior if needed.

I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.\nSean, Good Will Hunting (Park Bench Scene)\nAlthough my previous blog post was expected to be an explanation of what I assumed to be something I adopted a long time ago and never updated before:\nbut I have never revised the list since a while\nAdding new friends system I never expected the system to be perfect, or that I was doing what is ultimately right. The reason why I felt I should be listing this legacy system of adding new friends by writing the blog post , is because I felt it was the time to rethink it. I wasn’t explicit about this, (meaning it took me time to realize that I really need to rethink it.), but I felt this shouldn’t continue. The case analysis is not as good as it used to be in helping classifying people, many cases violated the rules, but the system still pulls me back to use its methods. [!IMPORTANT] I will be using the terms system and legacy system interchangeably. The term legacy system refers to an outdated but still functional computer system, software, or hardware that continues to be used because it performs its original, essential tasks, even as newer technologies emerge.\n[!NOTE] I deliberately selected the term value when saying assigning the name “Friend”, because it is not just a word, I consider it a value. Calling you a friend adds the values that require me to “allow myself to fall, to invest my emotions.”\nby this elboration I hope to clear the misconceptions that might accure from my previous writing, it build on top of the previous blog post Adding new friends system , you might want to take a look if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. this conversation will particularly discuss the cases where the system is not good enough, why I was still using it?, how it is so bad to the people who should be friends.\nWhy so many rules? Life is meant to be simple. There are many levels to look into why I don’t actually find it hard to rank people.one is Checklist based thinking happens everywhere, by everyone. First impressions are a sort of ranking system, and most people don’t take any effort in check listing their candidates, because it happens in the background of their minds, embedded just like first impressions.\nThe same happens to me, except that I might be using more rigorous tests. So I’m not really adding logic to the equation of life, it’s already there.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m not really walking around ranking people according to my checklist of what I favor, it is my mind that blocks me from transcending a relationship beyond what it is, unless it satisfies what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. this can act as a reason for why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so urgent about changing it, because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really suffering from it, it is something that happens almost naturally.\nAll the cool friends I could’ve made When establishing relationships, it is almost always the case that I don\u0026rsquo;t assign the value friend to them easily, lets call these people \u0026ldquo;candidates\u0026rdquo;, The best scenario is to have candidates who don’t care whether I gave this title to them or not; they don’t even ask about it. They see that I’m doing my best to match their energy.\nbut you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should\nAdding new friends system We’re supposed to enjoy the relationship without hindrance. I would do a great job at this, they would know I’m someone who never minds spending quality time with them, that I respect them, and am always happy to see them. Until they start to investigate their role within me too early.\nAnd if this happens, they won’t like it. They’ll translate me not adding them to the “friends” list as being heartless, as though they’re the ones taking part in the relationship, not me.\nI’d love if the universe worked according to my rules: why care about titles when I’m already there for you? But in the end, it’s not their fault. I shouldn’t have adopted this system in the first place, let alone explaining its creepiness to people or expecting them to understand it.\nHandling the misconceptions about “I will magically force myself to never invest emotions in the relationship” will take part shortly in this post, but for now, remember that the legacy system seemed to work for what I wanted it to do.\nhowever it does a greater job preventing “bad friends“. It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends) and this is where it helps me the most.\nAdding new friends system As long as it helps me make friends, and provides the definitions and rules of human interaction to me, I have no problem using it. But the real question is: why am I still using this legacy system?\nElaborating on the effects but there are downsides you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself.\nAdding new friends system Yes, I control the amount of love I stream toward someone/candidate, even if they were perfect candidates. I won’t send them any signals that strengthen our bond. I’ll avoid them. I’ll do what it takes to not invest emotion, and I’m good at it.\nI only stream what I think is sufficient to match their energy. The real downside is when this loop continues. They feel the walls I’m building hindering the relationship, and at that particular point I get disturbed.\nAt this stage, the best scenario is to respect the walls and plan to tear them down over time (though sometimes they’re never meant to be broken).\n1. Leakage in the system. In theory, I get to decide that I will not invest emotions, by controlling the amount of lets say love I stream for someone (love implies trust), just as computational theories ignore practical constraints, but in practice, emotions are not precisely controlled; they leak easily\n2. a double-edged sword. it is very common that I lose potential good friends in the process, and that hurts, seeing cool people leave. they realize how hard it is to deal with me, and then stop trying.\nThis cycle of people showing genuine interest in me, then suddenly losing it, is hard. It happened when I wasn’t aware that I had so many walls, that people aren’t good at climbing them. I was ignorant, selfish, not giving guidance on how to approach me.\nThinking it’s your thing to figure me out, who did I think I was? King Richard the Fifth? May I never trust my judgment again.\n3. But I\u0026rsquo;m hurt 2. What once felt unbearable to remember now feels necessary to recall. This one almost slipped out of memory, but when I lost those potential cool “friends,” I wasn’t happy about it. I remember now that I didn’t like it at all.\nI felt destined to live alone, not knowing I was drowning by my own design. I was too young to realize this. And instead of revising the list of rules I set to add new friends, to make them less rigorous, I fed it even more.\nWhy the legacy system is still in production Besides the system doing its job, there were boosters that helped keep it running.\nLet go before they let go:\nThe cycle of people entering and leaving my life left a scar. I started letting go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself caused these bad experiences to accumulate. It taught me that people leave, so I began preemptively leaving first.\n“People will stop trying to know you, you piece of shit. You’re setting the walls so high they won’t even try to climb them.” telling myself. And I had no idea that it was me causing this. That’s how two insecurities start boosting each other.\nThe legacy system is not helping me establishing new friendships (pending status cases). People are letting go of me because of this embedded legacy system. I let go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself helps me in the process of letting go of the people The legacy system says \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re anxious that they might leave you. I can help you to get rid of them preemptively.\u0026rdquo; The system rewards me by \u0026ldquo;either way, they might have been bad friends or they didn\u0026rsquo;t pass the tests\u0026rdquo;. man screw the tests.\nin short this monster was feeding itself. and apparently me.\nIrresistible features:\nMy sister once made an observation during a family discussion about our dark past selves. She noticed that growing up (me), I had access to the bad world, with tons of potential bad friends I could’ve made, but I chose not to.\nThe system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, actual true negatives, the ones that really would’ve hurt me. The problem is, it also keeps making false positives: rejecting people who were good, who could’ve stayed. It convinces me that losing them was just self protection,Though it’s hard to take the burden of \u0026ldquo;controlling the stream of love towards someone\u0026rdquo;, it’s also hard to be stabbed in the back. The system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, There was no other way, it was either being armed with it or being naïve and cut by friends.\nI’m good at keeping myself busy:\nThe legacy system not only controls how much love I give to people, it controls how many people I give it to.\nThose I call friends rarely exceed five or ten. I keep myself busy, which limits how many interactions I can manage. I’ve learned I don’t need to make a friend in every new country or city I live in, not doing so doesn’t kill me.\nI manage the few friends I have very well. They give me more than enough. I don’t plan to have many friends, it’s not aligned with my social energy or resources. The legacy system is good at controlling that number. It’s a win-win.\nAnswers not found elsewhere:\nSometimes I think about dismantling the system and moving on, but questions arise:\nHow do I prevent wounds if I step outside my walls?\nHow do I define friendship as something prestigious and not instantly given?\nThe first fence in the system is crucial, it helps control the number of people in my life. I can’t be friends with everyone I meet; I’d end up with too many.\nQuestions the legacy system fails to answer Some questions the system simply can’t answer well:\nWhat should I do if they figure it out?\nPeople go through painful ups and downs during the “pending” phase. They lose meaning in establishing a relationship once they realize they’re not assigned a value yet.\nI wasn’t trained to trust people this fast, but it’s not right to keep them hanging. The system doesn’t guide me here: should I explain it? Should I force myself to love them or assign the value they deserve?\nWhat should I do with pending requests?\nSome people are never meant to enter, I prefer keeping walls between us. The system doesn’t provide guidance.\nI remember a friend, culturally a friend, but I never really invested in him. He was great, but I didn’t want to allow myself to fall into that bond. Poor him, what did he have to do with my hormones? Again, the system didn’t help.\n404 Not Found:\nSometimes I fail to migrate relationships outside the scope of the greater good , that shared purpose that once connected us.\nI meet cool people in cool places; we like each other. But once the shared context is gone, I can’t find a new reason to stay connected.\nOutside the greater good:\nSome people are great under the scope of a project or purpose, but outside it, I can’t find what links us. Their attempts get pended.\nUndefined “something”:\nothertimes its more specific cases, For example, someone once part of my team, ideally female, wanted to get to know me outside of that shared goal. “Female friend”? I have no definition for that. How should I act? I don’t know, but I’ll definitely run away from anything undefined, lol.\nIf this isn’t your case, good for you. Some people don’t suffer from basic questions like deciding whether to make someone a friend or not. But I do, not enough to urgently change, but enough to notice it.\nI can still approach people, create one sided friendships, get what I need, make them smile, make them do what I want gently, wish them well, and support their wins.\nMost importantly, I can keep myself busy enough to avoid looking too closely at my malfunctioning legacy system.\ntoday! I’ve unlocked a hidden insecurity that’s been operating subconsciously, one I partly knew existed but never realized how much it was feeding other insecurities.\nThis moment of self-awareness feels like progress. I just need to unlearn it now. It might take years, but I’ve begun.\n","title":"Elaborate: Adding New Friends System","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"I get asked:\nHow do you deal with ordinary people? The ones that don\u0026rsquo;t bother you? and when does it start that they enter your life?\nThis question has got me thinking. I recalled that checklist (set of rules) I have for making new friends, but I have never revised the list for a while. I have seen cases where people just hack the system, and suddenly they are knocking on the door of my heart before even check-listing half of it.\nThe set of rules I have adapted is simple enough to help me make new friends; however, it does a greater job preventing “bad friends.” It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends), and this is where it helps me the most. More about it later; first, let’s get to see where this starts.\nIn elementary school, I made the observation that most people around me complain about how they were betrayed, stabbed in the back, or any sort of resentment that happened to them, caused by relationships, particularly friendships. To make sense of why they suffer, my observation was: “All these people you were hurt by, you had positive feelings about them; you loved them.\u0026quot; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be in such a position, so I learned through preaching to myself.\nthe equation was obvious to me: \u0026ldquo;the more emotions I invest in someone, the deeper the wound is,\u0026rdquo; and you start investing emotions in people the moment you assign them the name \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; in your head. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall this equation resulting in me being afraid of making friendships, but what I did was to learn from them. What I learned is that many cases were wounded because they were too early in assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the people they met.\nAs social creatures, we tend to make friendships in the new places or paths we take (new school, new university, new habit…) or sometimes when we feel lonely, or even worse, when we are too optimistic. However, these reasons do not respect the slow pace needed for making friendships; they are in a rush. For example, a fresher might feel either very overwhelmed by the number of questions they got, so they try to establish friendships (either to feel no guilt if people also turn out not to have answers, or to have answers), or very energized by the amount of sudden freedom they were never granted before, and they want to make friends to do all sorts of crazy things they want to do. So whether your reasons were noble (work on study groups, research, projects, politics) or less impactful (host parties, go to the park), they are all tagged with urgency. Of course, you can\u0026rsquo;t wait two years to make a friend.\nFor these very reasons, \u0026ldquo;bad friends\u0026rdquo; happen, that we needed to call someone a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; we had tons of emotions that couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold their horses and needed someone to run for.\nHow I planned to overcome this? Simply don\u0026rsquo;t call people your \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; I haven’t used that term for as long as I can remember. My very first friend, I was telling myself about \u0026ldquo;Wow, this guy has done so much for me. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to call him a friend, then I\u0026rsquo;m selfish and heartless\u0026rdquo;. What people don\u0026rsquo;t understand is that I still had a quality time with that guy without calling him a friend. I was enjoying my life with them, and I was making memories.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve applied what happened with the first person I ever admitted by heart as a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the friends I met down the road, is to never call them friends until time passes and they prove they are trustworthy.\nIf you keep saying everyone is your friend, you will end up wounded alot.\nBut there are downsides, you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you are going to be in defense mode all the time (or it is not that bad; maybe you will get used to it), but you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should. But don\u0026rsquo;t call them friends, not yet, because the moment you start assigning them the value \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; you allow yourself to invest more emotions (trust, love, loyalty…). If you have an argument saying friendship should not be that hard, and at the start I don\u0026rsquo;t really allow myself to fall completely, then this is good for you, but for me, no. Assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to people means a lot more, so I don\u0026rsquo;t give it away that easily. Luckily, society gave us names as placeholders for people that even can help define the interactions and limits of relationships to have with people: there are Coworkers, Neighbors, Classmates, Colleagues, Managers, Team members, Collaborators, Customers, Clients, Students, Teachers, and even Mutuals (your friend\u0026rsquo;s friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be your friend). Why don\u0026rsquo;t people use these? They are good, they protect you, they help you.\nGoing back to our discussion, the reason why I want to revise my set of rules for making new friends as mentioned before is that there seem to be people who violate the rules. They are just cool enough to make friendships with; they can\u0026rsquo;t stay just \u0026ldquo;people,\u0026rdquo; they need to be \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; And they already have the same amount of admiration as my friends, but I\u0026rsquo;m yet to call them \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; This nonsense happens for a lot of reasons; let\u0026rsquo;s list some:\nThe experiences I went through in making friends were very long in terms of duration, and this is purely by chance. My very first friends took a long time to call them friends — years. This was reflected in some way in my subsequent experiences (I started to consider taking more time just as how my first friendships took more time to bond). This might be nonsense, but that means even if someone passed the checklist in under six months, and they were finally qualified to be \u0026ldquo;friends,\u0026rdquo; without a year or two passing by, I can\u0026rsquo;t call them friends.\nIn simple terms, the way I formed friendship was that I get to know people very slowly and we disappear for years in the middle. This reflected that I don\u0026rsquo;t make people friends easily.\nAnother reason is to be mindful of the greater good we are serving. This is very common in relationships of University and Work because there is often a greater purpose that must be served and is compromised the moment we call ourselves \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; A good example would be a woman called Samar Yahia. Samar ages me by about ten years. We were co-founders of a startup at some point, and we just met. I never knew who she was, she knew who I am, and we never met to this very day although we live in the same city. Why? Simply because we prioritize the greater good of the startup by being co-founders/co-workers. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a great time; we had amazing conversations, laughter, we shared experiences and life lessons, we allowed ourselves to enjoy the process, and never made it boring. But let\u0026rsquo;s just not take it to the next level of being friends even if it feels right. If I ever get the chance to meet Samar in an alternative world, we would have been great friends, or if we had something other than work.\nThe last one is that I want to protect either myself or someone by not going to be a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; and it is better to have walls between. An example would be: Ahmed is a cool new freshman at the university, and I want to take him under my wings by making friendship with him, aka investing emotions. But I might not do that. Although he passed the checklist and is now a good candidate, I might prefer to keep the default relationship (colleague) assigned to him. Why? Well, since he is too young, I’m not sure if by this sudden access to all sorts of amusement and ideologies, he will remain the one I hoped to make friendship with. This way I can protect myself from making friendships with Ahmed. Another pattern that happens a lot, is the other way around: University colleagues try to get to know me outside the University, and they are often pushed by walls I build to protect them from me. I don’t want them to invest their emotions in me because I don’t see myself as trustworthy, that I\u0026rsquo;m not someone they can really rely on, and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust myself to handle that responsibility, at least not yet. This way, I protect them (and many times hurt them) using the walls I build and keeping them away from my friends zone, and most importantly, keep myself away from their friends zone.\nAt the end, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just a traumatized kid formalizing all these rules to make friendship. In reality, I don\u0026rsquo;t really suffer from this. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m good at reaching out to people and making friendships. I don\u0026rsquo;t struggle to communicate with people or get what I want. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a bad time searching for quality time. And thinking about how much worse it could be without these rules, I remind myself to be grateful.\nWhat kind of walls do you mean exactly?\nThe first one, I assume, is to act ordinary (which is a product of the walls but it\u0026rsquo;s just the first fence), acting ordinary is to not reveal the basic information about me, my name, my age, what I do in life.

I only allow a certain amount of information to get leaked from what I\u0026rsquo;m doing in my life. What I want to do. I\u0026rsquo;m not giving or sharing what violates my privacy. this includes (my family, my moves, my trips, my quality time, my free time, my friends, my performance, my upside-downs)\nless in height, subtle insecurities I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to involve people in.\n","title":"Adding new friends system","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"To nerd out and talk about a particular topic that you are deeply interested in/ obsessed with, requires you to unveil part of yourself. Your personality, your affection, your love for that topic. Often, it feels like dancing in the symphony of that subject(my analogy is very consumed, but I feel it holds true here).\nWhile jumping between discussions on Substack , I found myself watching this Kurt Vonnegut lecture.\nWatch the lecture Although I enjoyed the whole presentation, I was most impressed by his performance in the final minutes, the way he left the stage, his funny moves and gestures. This wasn’t unique to the ending, though. The way he spoke and carried himself throughout the lecture was “unique.”\nUnique to him.\nIt felt like this was how his soul interpreted information or felt about it, how it reacted to the joy of sharing his inner reasoning and experiences. You could sense the years of thought and accumulation behind every word. The jokes, the gestures, the rhythm, they were all expressions of his love for what he was saying.\nI found myself imagining a kind of paradise around the idea that he was never ashamed of being himself. Because when you look at him, he was doing weird stuff, awkward moves, overly specific jokes, yet the audience loved it. They understood and accepted his (uniqueness soon will be called awkwardness). They even craved it.\nuniqueness is just him being true to himself, acting natural and manifesting what he feels in the way he likes\nif this uniqueness exists in an alternative world, a world where he couldn’t be himself freely, where his natural self would be judged as strange akward. where his uniqueness is akwardness.\nWatching him leave the stage while everyone clapped, appreciating what he had shared, reminded me of how many intellectuals from my country travel abroad to pursue their careers in the United States or other Western nations that seem to value what they can offer.\noften saying,\nMy skills were welcomed in the country of Uncle Sam.\nThis isn’t about how the United States has built the perfect habitats for nerds and anyone who wants to be themselves; by embracing people as they are and shaping social norms around tolerance, rather than judgment.\nIt’s more about how bad I feel coming from regions where being your true self is misunderstood, misused, and simpy is a crime.\nAt that particular moment, watching him leave the stage, I remembered how unlucky we are for not growing up in environments that encourage us to nerd out, to share the things we are obsessed with in our own way, or even to share them at all.\nYou don’t know how many times I’ve tried to have deep discussions with people who are truly good at something(they are nerds about particular subject), just to crack through their insecurities and show them:\n“I’m a good listener. I won’t judge. Only love. I won’t be freaked out by your awkwardness. I’m more interested in hearing you express your passion naturally, not formally or shyly. You know you’re obsessed with it deep down — and there’s no reason to feel guilty about that with me.”\nCracking those defense walls is never easy.\nAnd it’s not their fault.\nIt’s the world they were born into, one that never prioritized who they truly are.\n","title":"Where You Are Allowed To Be You","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/where_you_are_allowed_to_be_you/"},{"content":"When making decisions in life, especially when we are faced with selecting between two events, we find ourselves comparing how important they are in order to determine which event we should choose. Some people study the implications of each decision and measure how rewarding or penalizing the outcomes might be. Picking the least penalty is a tactic for choosing a decision under this scenario.\nI first encountered this three years ago in one of Jeff Bezos’s interviews. he called it the Regret Minimization Framework. This tactic can be used on a smaller scale, even in daily decisions like getting out of bed or not. I’m sure you’ve used this tactic today in your own decision making process as a kind of mental tool. Usually, it helps me clarify priorities and take action with confidence. But what I’m here to share is a funny story: for the very first time, I was unable to use this utility in my decision making process.\nTwo events were taking place in the same hour block the next morning (8:00 AM). To make a decision, I defaulted my brain to use the regret minimization method. Unfortunately, the two events were equally likely in their consequences, at least from what my mind could list. Of course, life can have consequences that shows the advantages of one selection over the another, but I’m yet to know this and I need to make decisions under what I only know, and able to consider at the particular time I’m given this.\nIt felt exactly like how mathematical reasoning falls apart when dividing by zero, or how classical physics fails to explain things at small scales. This dilemma, of having two equally important events with either equally likely outcomes or vague consequences, made the regret minimization method fail completely. And honestly, that was a funny realization, because I’m rarely hesitant in making decisions. I know exactly what if I want to make a decision over another.\nMaybe I expected too much from this method,or misused it,but that’s not really the point I want to highlight. Perhaps this reflection doesn’t offer a grand piece of wisdom, but you can still take something from it: explore new ways of making decisions in your own life. Experiment with frameworks or tactics that help you choose the optimal option more often. And most importantly, pick an option, don’t stay up until (3:42 AM) like me, still undecided and unable to sleep.\n","title":"The Limits of the Regret Minimization Framework","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_limits_of_the_regret_minimization_framework/"},{"content":" Everyone is atheist until the plane starts falling. I have no clue who said this.\nThe numerous different stories that act as catalysts for returning to God and thinking about the existence of a grand designer or creator, shared by people across the globe, are interesting. There are a variety of patterns, and often the most interesting ones are those concluded through epistemic rationality rather than convenience or bias—where there was evidence that God existed, for them. One pattern is how God existed in everyday life. A good example is the historical belief that the creation of all temples and religions around the world throughout history is an innate, lowkey, subtle need for God.\nAnd this is what I’m interested in pulling strings from and building upon—what I felt right before I sleep. I’m not diving into theology, but rather sharing a concept I just coined: “Gratitude Register.” This is what I assume as the “where I find God” in my “everyday life pattern.” No matter what beliefs I’m holding or how religious or spiritual I am at a particular point in time, at the end of the day (literally) I find myself accounting for what was good today and in my life. This happens by default; it’s the way your psyche validates the day, your memory works, and you yourself try to make sense of all the nonsense you were doing throughout the day. Depending on how I define good (which of course includes biased beliefs or definitions from religion), I can bring different combinations of them. Now, if these things outweigh the misfortunes I have, that means it is a good day (again, there is no agreed upon way of defining and measuring misfortunes). Hence, some positive feelings may start to appear—one that stands out so loudly is gratitude. This feeling is a well known visitor, outshining others through its powerful urge.\nGratitude: “I’m here.” Translation: I’m grateful. Gratitude: “I need to make a decision so fast (urge).” Translation: I need to be grateful “for someone.”\nTranslation is what the mind tells about the chemicals.\nThis urge—and the small space I get to make the decision to fill it with someone—is what makes gratitude such a special “positive feeling.” This is how I translate it as a way to know God, and I’m feeling it every day. To know this Gratitude Register (just like how a CPU register is filled quickly and needs to assign the value to some process) requires some form of mental allocation.\nIf it happens and if I’m a full time atheist (I don’t wish that for anyone) I believe this interaction, of validating my day and unconsciously inviting “gratitude” as a result of just being human, shall rescue me from muddle and may guide me toward the light.\nThis is a piece of my honest and truthful analysis of my feelings toward gratitude.\n","title":"Gratitude Register","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/gratitude_register/"},{"content":" do things badly\nAs the years pass by, I find myself adapting to different reasons to keep living, and to share, I\u0026rsquo;m not as clear as I used to be about why I should be posting something publicly, but looking back over the years, I recall how writing started. How reasons changed.\nThe Seeds of Writing I\u0026rsquo;ve had amazing language teachers (Tahia and Jamal), who encouraged me to write and read since I was a little I\u0026rsquo;ve been under the wings of people who are naturally good at writing (this probably influenced me, I mean, I used to write poetry when I was a little) I felt the need to express my feelings through writing (I\u0026rsquo;ve been actively journaling since 8th grade) I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen in love with quotes and I became a collector at some point, they seemed to explain the world, so I started crafting my own through writing (High school/teenager period) I\u0026rsquo;ve wished people could write more about their experiences and not generic content When I needed someone to talk about Computer Science from their heart, experience, and not what they have studied Reem\u0026rsquo;s blog was my savior, and then later I loved the writings of Mohammed Yousif especially the self-reflection notes, and his feelings. I wanted to document my journey in life, I wished that the elderly people in my life had books/blogs that they had left behind for me, so I can get to know them more, even after they\u0026rsquo;re gone. I wanted to make sense of my doings, I would write the task I should be doing for myself to see if I understand the procedure that is supposed to happen, and if there are any subtle pitfalls in my understanding I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of. Yes, these are all different reasons, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how I\u0026rsquo;m going to organize them, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to overthink this.\nDemons but I got demons\u0026hellip;. that were holding me from writing.\nI get amazed by the number of clicks I write on the keyboard everyday writing something. and it is really fascinating how I barely share it publicly. I\u0026rsquo;m not in my best to recall the WHY behind why I\u0026rsquo;ve been skeptical about this, but below are what I can list now:\nBeing busy is the biggest factor for not sharing it publicly, not that I can\u0026rsquo;t press post/publish but that I have a cognitive overload from being busy, I get to experience and learn lesson on the fly which I assume its a bless. but it comes in huge numbers and sometimes hard to unpack what I\u0026rsquo;ve learn. so they time between me taking the lesson and preparing to share the lesson spans, if I assigned a name to this period, lets say C, there will even more lessons that will pop in that period which lead to me giving up completely on sharing.\nNot making sense of how this would help me. there was a time where I\u0026rsquo;ve had lost the meaning and I was blinded by something that I don\u0026rsquo;t know, the prevented me from seeing how this can help me in any way (practically speaking, yes I had reasons to write but not to share)? (later I found some reasons to share).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the writing tools: at that age being afraid is the default, I was telling myself if that x human is better than you at writing and knows how why would you still share? they got the experience, they got the talent, the got the time, they got the confidence. looking to back to how small I was to start such a thing makes sense.\nDo people call it a comfort zone?: I recall in 2023-2025 I stopped a number of my social media accounts repeatedly, until this very day, I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet posted one single status on my main WhatsApp account. And months can pass without sharing something publicly, now this has its own story, but it was one big reason that I\u0026rsquo;ve felt comfort in not being in public/ in not sharing, even if that is on social media.\nPrioritize what\u0026rsquo;s important: there is also a time when I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at the words that I\u0026rsquo;m writing, and that I should be sharing, but not to everyone, maybe I can do this to my closest people first, family, and friends. They deserve better, someone who is not being busy, but being responsive and collaborative. So throughout the last 2 years, I was investing more in my closest circle.\nDetails and setup: everyone has their own unique way of communicating, with mutual culture you get to say what you want smoothly (by smoothly I mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t face difficulties in deciding what to say and the recipient is not having trouble interpreting your words to what you actually meant) if we were to imagine how deviated I\u0026rsquo;m from that line, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not as close. maybe in reality I can relate and talk to people, but inside my head I overthink and over-engineer what I should say to the person in-front of me based on the data they are directly or indirectly steaming to me, will they relate to what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, are they comfortable talking about this, are they going to feel offended, am I talking fast, and not showing them the point, did I match their energy/slang, was the conversation interactive?, dozens of questions, now image you are talking to over thousand person, thats what I put in my mind and heart before sharing anything publicly. Now these details are hard to overcome.\nI\u0026rsquo;m wasting my time here: this is a real demon here, it tells me that the time I would spend in writing and then responding to people\u0026rsquo;s comments, inquiries, friendships, rituals out of curiosity about me from my posts, can be dedicated to doing something more useful, I would spend more time doing more important things maybe.\nmoving forward This blog website is an attempt; it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be the last one, but I have faith in it.#\n","title":"Why I’m Sharing Notes","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-do-this/"},{"content":" Early to rise early to bed, makes a man healthy but socially dead\nOne thing that i\u0026rsquo;m sure about is, that I don\u0026rsquo;t miss people easily, not that I don\u0026rsquo;t bare people, or I\u0026rsquo;m antisocial. but I keep myself busy to the point I forget about the people, I feel sorry for myself and for the people I know that I\u0026rsquo;m emotionally inactive when I need it.

Those first 21 years were upheavals.\nI grew up playing video games and memorizing/reciting Quran under the mentorship of Shiekha Entisar, my best friend’s mother. I had the chance to pursue an education. Even though I was a high performer, I scored only average on entrance exams and never paid attention to my academic pursuits during the bottleneck years that mattered the most.\nLately I learned to love my family and friends.

I used to document at this time of the year, where I try as much as possible to reflect on the progress made this year, perhaps my learning process. Alhamdullah, I have learned a lot. And I have tales to tell, but hopefully, choosing the most significant one will find a wider audience and fit. I will talk in 3s three categories and 3 notes\nI will talk about What I learned about the world What I learned about the people What I learned about myself. I\u0026rsquo;m not very visionary and dreamy, so I think about life directly, but here are some lessons that I learned.\nWhat you learn models the way you think. We try as much as possible to interpret the complexity of the world and answer the why and how behind things; the way we think and use our minds is completely different based on what we have learned, and dictates how we will view the world. If that\u0026rsquo;s chemistry, you will look at life as a chemical reaction, a mathematician viewing it as a melody of logic, a writer as stories, and so on.\nThe reality has nothing to do with your hope. Life is very unpredictable; you can\u0026rsquo;t say good things happen for good people, or I have put too much into this project hence it will succeed, life has nothing to do with your hope.\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t pursue happiness directly. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall when was the last time I heard someone asking whether you are happy or not, and how to be happy. It looks like everyone is suddenly not talking about happiness, which is good in my opinion. Happiness is something you pursue indirectly.\nhere comes the people. Unexpected Time Sink You respawned in this world hoping that you would spend most of the time doing what you love, but then you realized that a great portion of your time is dedicated to people, some of them whom you might like, and others you will force yourself to adapt wasting time with.\ncheerful face and sweet words You can get what you want with a cheerful face and sweet words: People hold positions, some of them control the valves of opportunities. What I found is, besides having the potential to fit the need, if you have reached out, cold emailed, or any sort of communication, people will help you make things out.\nPeople have feelings, I guess. They feel, every single action you do influences the way they look at you. If you never show up for their invitations, if you were a bit off that day, your tune changed. I fooled myself for a long time, thinking that people would never notice the small things that I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\nAbout me. Struggle to see things from their perspective I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I can\u0026rsquo;t fully understand someone else\u0026rsquo;s situation unless I have been through something similar or if I am able to simulate/mimic/imagine the same circumstances. For instance,, if I live in the big city of Khartoum with a 9 - 5 job anda regular pace of life, I will never be able to generalize what people might suffer from and what challenges they face in different parts of Sudan. I just can\u0026rsquo;t.\nKeeping up, what is that? I\u0026rsquo;m the worst when it comes to keeping up with people and the news. In order to feel natural and get along with most of today\u0026rsquo;s youth and even adults, you need to have a middle ground to talk about, in most cases, football, politics, and news, which I don\u0026rsquo;t really bother myself to follow. So this is one of the things I learned that I simply suck at bringing topics to the middle ground.\nAvoiding Regret I love video editing/storytelling, tho I\u0026rsquo;m not editing as much as I used to, but it\u0026rsquo;s still one of the things that I loved doing naturally and unconditionally. I never admit to saying it verbally, but the reason I\u0026rsquo;m making videos is to capture a snapshot of time, just like git versions the code. The main incentive behind doing this action. is to avoid regret. I can\u0026rsquo;t live with this burden in my chest. There are dozens of videos that I discarded, many of which I\u0026rsquo;ve never started.

I’m not the best at making analogies, but I will tell the story of stochastic processes and my conversation with Zainab. She’s a Computer Science major who devoted more time and effort to mathematics while also maintaining good grades in CS related subjects. She shared me the work of a mathematician in stochastic processes after winning a Nobel prize on his word, or Fields Medal I really can’t recall it. we were arguing about how he managed to imagine these things, let alone architecting a framework to explain it, Although we tried to “wonder” but we come from completely different backgrounds, as I see stochastic processes from practical Machine Learning point of view, mainly thinking of “if I never set a random seed I might never reproduce my same results again, my weights will always initialize randomly, the gradient will always give different results/trough when minimizing the cost function”, Zainab is coming from a completely different background thinking about the mathematics how differential equations are implemented…etc.\nThis idea of things being as you imagine them, or as the image you are able to craft by generalizing from previous experiences, is something I often think about.\nHow to benefit from this lesson. Assuming you want to study a material in a new subject that you have never studied before, you will have generalization ability to predict how it\u0026rsquo;s going to be, but the reality might be different. and sure it is different, from the things that you can think of, it is always better to do the process to know how things are. quantum mechanics seems like you will be imagining where the cat is, what will happen if I observe it, but in reality, you will be doing differential equations, which will shape the framework of how you think about these problems. So this might let you think twice that THINGS ARE NOT AS YOU IMAGINE them, don’t let your assumptions fool you.\nInstead, it should be a part of your learning process, when you hit the realization of what actually this topic is talking about, for a very long time, I thought calculus is about calculation, after reading it I knew that it was talking about the rates of changing, and now I view as the art of dealing with tight spaces, and I will keep changing my assumption about it as I go, or maybe adding to the previous once. so having this flexibility will always help.\n","title":"What you want to major in might not be exactly what you imagine it to be","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/what_you_want_to_major_in_might_not_be_exactly_how_you_imagine_it/"},{"content":"Lately, I lost my ability to focus and maintain a flow state.

Will I be able to go through the mud as I entered the 20? Will the opportunities come? Will the things I love remain the same? Would I remain settled even after experiencing my 20s? Will I be able to interpret the complexity of the world and answer these questions, or just be the silent man who never ever thinks beyond his responsibilities? Or I will just ignore all the questions, and say in everything and every time there will be a crack, and it\u0026rsquo;s where the light gets in. And I should never create competitions and challenges that don’t exist yet. I’m sure Allah swt will guide me in every step, and just focus on what matters and eventually everything will come, and keep believing that all the things that I have lost will find their way to me. And it will come back to me. I’m turning 20 next week. Here are some lessons I think I learned in my teens, I may change my mind about some of them in the future.\nYour family must be no.1 priority in your life. You must have one thing that your life revolves around(Religion, category of people). People are not good at understanding themselves. Being Busy can prevent you from doing stupid things, and at the same time from good things, make sure to balance. Sleep early and wake up early. Don’t create competitions that doesn’t exist, be realistic. You can explore life in your teens and 20s and be a generalist, but set a limit for that and try to specialize and focus on the important parts. Routine is the small steps you take towards every big goal you set for yourself. A good level of understanding yourself, is knowing what you are not good at. If you’re a junior and you think you are smarter than an old outdated seniors, think twice; they have experience. Someone may find your presence warm and lovely without you knowing, so always be kind. If people do like you and you don’t know why, try to know why and keep practicing this thing for the rest of your life. Memories are the most warm feeling in the world, and the time you’re remembering them, will always be a happy time. I guess Happening is something that you pursue indirectly. Pray to Allah for giving you a clear mind, and practice exercise, eliminate distractions and you will have super flow state. Our beliefs are changing every time and we probably notice that late. If you ever felt happy for no reason try to ask yourself why? Write it down and read it when you’re down. Being optimistic about something and putting massive emotions into it doesn’t mean it will succeed. Reality is just independent of your thoughts Sad, or in pain? This will always come back at some point; you gotta use the time you have when you’re at your best. You may hurt people without knowing that you did, so you need to make sure you apologize frequently and ask people about how you behave. Chasing one thing will make the other things run away, like chasing a job but your health is in danger. You can be good at anything, including research and engineering, without a university, but the university is still important. We are not alike in the way we receive new information and knowledge; some know how to extract every possible information out of it, while others don’t. Mainstream titles like “entrepreneurship” can wait, and people who are seeking it since early ages of their career or uni want only the money, but they don’t have the needed skills and capacity to be the one. You may be good at using one of the technologies that uses scientific methods, but till you should always be humble to that outdated professor who spends his life solving equations and teaching math that you see as useless. You just didn’t realize the importance of it yet and the impact he is having. Avoid blaming your family members ","title":"20","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/20/"},{"content":"One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on Facebook , not consistently, and then I went through what I called “ Manulasis ”(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.\nThis happened because of the overwhelming number of times I discarded posts, notes, videos, or images I intended to share. Eventually, I gave up and abandoned the whole idea, and in doing so, I vanished from reality. This hesitation wasn’t new to me; I’ve been repeating this pattern since childhood. I would have sudden peaks of exposing my thoughts to the world, followed by long troughs of detachment and isolation. The amount of life that happens during those troughs makes it difficult to say everything when I finally try to reconnect with the world again.\nIf I turn a blind eye to the complexity, one of the strongest incentives behind sharing my notes is the fear of regret . I have been running from this feeling most of my life. The idea that all the messages, reflections, and thoughts I discarded will haunt me in the future terrifies me. This fear is closely tied to the feeling of standing on the Day of Judgment, knowing I had something that might help someone, but I never shared it. Recording what I’ve learned is a way to pass something forward to future generations.\n","title":"Why Im Sharing Notes - Regret","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-im-sharing-notes-regret/"},{"content":" There\u0026rsquo;s an anecdote about Richard Feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on Mr Feynman desk and makes a comment about these being a record of Feynman\u0026rsquo;s thinking and then Mr Feynman corrects the historian and says that: these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you\u0026rsquo;re thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that\u0026rsquo;s when Mr Feynman says: no they aren\u0026rsquo;t a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.\nIf I were to say the most important feature of making my life interpretable, it would be writing. I make sense of what is changing in my life through my writing, publicly, I don’t mention exciplicitly what is changing, but instead I just write. mostly about my beliefs, what I value, and the challenge I’m facing at the time. I do it multiple times throughout the year, and just by comparison, I can tell what changed. This self-reflection can help me distinguish between actual growth and commitments I made due to bad experiences, whether I adopted sudo-nihilism to cope with misfortunes, or if my pace in learning is slow and the road is very steep. All sorts of learnings in my journey are coming from my writings.\nAround 2018, I and Abd Alwahab Were arguing about some existential questions as teenagers while walking along the train track in the borders of our little small town district of Al-Daroshab , I came up with the realization that all the people who have died, are unable in anyway to share the lessons they have learned, not even as single lesson. through any channel. I remember that I never stopped talking about that idea with him that day. Years later, after deepening my understanding of our religion, Islam, the importance and encouragement of knowledge sharing, and the intolerance of not sharing knowledge.\nAlthough the priority is sharing the Islamic teachings and standing beside what is right. But I found that sharing small, minor details of our lives might be valuable. Scarcity of information: I was lucky that I was provided with an abundance of resources and access to people whom I can ask questions. I was raised having a computer, a brother to guide me through the installation of translators and IDEs on my machine, although he only just told me the names, but I was born lucky to some extent. I couldn’t even comprehend the idea of thinking about how my life would have been without having access to all the people and information. What I learned as a child significantly influenced the person I have become today. I never had the chance to appreciate this. Until a later period of my life, when I noticed a pattern of how the availability of information can lead to different lives.\nIn my primary-schooling period, I was smarter than most kids in “Computer” lessons and labs. And the teachers always ask me the following questions\n“Where did you learn this from?” or “Does your father come from an IT background?” so there must be a source of information, as they are assuming there is a light that must have guided you. something that sparked the first interest. That has led you to the person you are today. The same question is being repeated to students who are excelling in math (I suck at math), and looking back after I investigate them, they also had some sort of access to information (private tutor, aspirations, someone recommended a book for them), and so on.\nA model to understand information sharing. During my last year in high school, I started to view the world as a big network of knowledge/information sharing. I teach you computer science subject(what I use to do) and Abdalrahman (Math nerd who used to teach us mathematics) no matter how you are good in one subject you will always need help from different people, who are either in the same specialization that you’re looking for help with, or something else, This result of this processing of sharing information is to facilitate lives.\nWhat is wisdom does it have something to do with Making life much easier: I remember taking a consultation from Ali Azam one day about what university to pick, he told me that the university you’re going to pick will determine your next five years if not having a contribution to your whole life. He guided me through how its not just the name and reputation of the university but also the city where you live and ..etc a very concise definition of wisdom that I developed is: better decision making.\nAs I see many people are thinking about wisdom that same way as knowledge and whenever they heard the world a wise man they imagine someone who’s moving around with 200 IQ and quote to say everywhere. They ignore the fact that a wise man not only knowing but make actions and decisions based on his information.\nIf you zoom into your lifespan you would find there is this one component of decision making that significantly influenced your life today/the person who you are.\nThese decision are sometimes big ; whether to continue education or not, sometimes small; should I read today or play, the word decision is not about just being prompt to select between 2 or multiple choices, but it’s what you’re doing everyday you’re unconsciously calculate if you are going to sleep early or not whether you want to skip your leg day or study… etc\nEvery decision matter, not making a choice is also a choice\nThings I feel sorry about: One of the things I felt would make my life so much easier is knowing how to do math. Throughout my schooling period, I never encountered a math teacher who encouraged me to love math or helped me to do it; they did the exact opposite, except for the statistics and probability experience. And no wonder I love statistics more.\nWhen I entered university, I had to deal with all the previous experiences that had affected me. The access to top-tier students helped me make better decisions based on what they have experienced from success, failures, for instance, my senior Zainab helped me significantly understand math structure, and that I lack prerequisites for some courses.\nThis information sharing resulted in making my life easier. Sure, the math I had to deal with wasn’t easy, but in the hope of making this decision of going back to prerequisites, no matter how hard it is, it made my life later easier.\nI have seen people who never stop talking, but I couldn’t mine any useful information that would facilitate my life, while with little chatting with the most introverted person in the room, I can get advice that I never had the chance to know about.\nI shared my experiences in multiple aspects of life, whether it\u0026rsquo;s something big like joining a computer science school or not, or minor like recommending a software.\nWhile I was scared people would make a decision based on my experience, I kept emphasizing the idea that they should use the information they obtained from me as a data point, not final words, and it\u0026rsquo;s based on my experience, I try as much as I can to be unbiased and to tell what matches their needs. sometimes I receive messages from people saying that the decision they made has led a successful results, AKA make their lives so much easier. which I found very fascinating. most people who can help with information will be hesitant to share it, and even the failure when sharing it can be used as a decision making by someone else; this is basically how our lives work.\nThe reason why I’m writing these articles is the hope that there is someone who will make use of them in one way, taking a single idea that would inshallah help make their life easier.\n","title":"Why I'm Sharing Notes — Learned Too Late","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why_im_sharing_notes/"},{"content":"Progress: One of the good things I lack in my life is receiving feedback. Usually, everyone assumes that I’m an expert at everything, and they tend to define the way of our communication based on my social presence (oh, that’s Ahmed, everyone likes this dude. he is amazing… etc) while the reality is significantly different. I know several quality skills, like anyone, without having superpowers, I know how to speak, communicate, but I guarantee you I’m not the best!, and there is alot that you don\u0026rsquo;t know about me.\nThe problem is the iconography that the presenters who lead conversations/first time meets tend to define me with! They overglorify my story and the person I am, and this is not serving me in any way. The smarter the presenter will present you, the more independent you are likely to become.\nAnd that was always the case: people treated me based on what they heard about me, and probably that was brighter in a way that blinded what they would hear from me later. All my attempts to correct that, are prone to failure.\nFeedbacks! In the early days of the university, the first feedback I got from my colleagues where something like; You look like a robot, you don’t seem to know what feelings are. And indeed, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing my best at camouflaging as a human, although I was good at communication, but people always felt lost finding the way to enter my sphere. So I decided to be more friendly, and I took it so seriously, it brought some results in many different aspects. But the feedbacks are gone, the compass I used to make the decision based on is no longer here.\n","title":"Lack of Real Feedback","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/lack_of_real_feedback/"},{"content":"I remember coming back to Sudan from Saudi Arabia when Abd Alwahab told me he had secured a scholarship in India and might travel to pursue it. After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.\nOne day, I visited him at home and saw him packing up his bags, and some of his luggage was already packed. I was slightly irritated. he was so happy about his future, and I was happy for him too. Two years ago, I remember watching a video he shot that day, looking at myself, I could see how drowned I was in my thoughts, completely silent. Not many days passed before he booked his flight tickets.\nI went to the airport feeling completely numb . I even remember that my sister drove me, although I insisted on riding alone. I tried to make sure his journey went smoothly, helped him with the procedures, and it wasn’t long before I saw him hugging his family. That day, I didn’t grieve silently; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold myself. When he came to hug me one last time, I cried like a child. It was the most terrible feeling I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn’t stop myself from crying. I cried the entire way back home, at home, and again the next morning.\nFor the first time, my feelings rushed without control, without regulation, without avoidance; I got to see how vulnerable I was. With everything I had repressed before, the very distinct thought in my head was translated as: “I don’t know what to do with my life anymore.” It felt like I had lost myself. It felt like there was an important definition in my life that was suddenly gone. Even though the tears subside, writing this was never easy. I’ve tried to interpret what happened that day many times before, but most of the time I avoided thinking about it. Even now, while writing this, remembering it makes me cry like a child.\nThe days after he left were empty. I felt depressed and had no motivation to do anything. This eventually developed into severe social anxiety . I dragged myself into a cycle of illnesses and panic attacks that didn’t stop.\nFor almost four years, I hid my pain from him, how the days felt when he wasn’t around. I focused on how happy he seemed exploring a new world. I wanted to match his happy feelings, but two months ago, during a FaceTime call, the conversation suddenly shifted to the day he left. I was triggered and cried like a child again. I had never healed from the emotions I kept avoiding; they were always there, repressed.\nit was a goodbye I never recovered from, that particular departure triggered years of anxiety I was subconsciously avoiding by keeping myself busy, I miss you more than you can imagine, my friend. Not having you around was the hardest thing I ever had to go through.\n","title":"The Moment I Realized What He Meant to Me","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-moment-i-realized-what-he-meant-to-me/"},{"content":" your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.\nIt’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.\nAvoidant attachment is a pattern where you feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness and tend to pull away or shut down when relationships start to feel too vulnerable. Deep down, you may still want connection, but it feels safer to stay distant, guarded, or independent.\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of this term “Avoidant attachment,” and it is crazy how accurately it sums up and explains the recurrence of my patterns, Adding new friends systems , Elaborate Adding new friends system On avoidant attachment after watching videos about this topic, I felt it’s relevant to what I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing, and I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how mature psychology is, to the point of describing such a phenomenon. Below I will paste a comprehensive summary that can help understand the avoidant personality in a nutshell, and build on top of its light.\nYour avoidant isn\u0026rsquo;t fine, they\u0026rsquo;re just numb, to you it registers as indifference, what if they\u0026rsquo;re gone, what if they\u0026rsquo;re done, what if they\u0026rsquo;re over this, but internally on their part, it is an emotional shutdown. Avoidant don\u0026rsquo;t walk away calm, they walk away frozen, they don\u0026rsquo;t process in the moment, they don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened. They retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection. They are avoiding the emotional bill that just hasn\u0026rsquo;t hit them yet, because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them early, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them after a day or after a week, it hits them later on. When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone, and when they think that you have stopped expecting anything from them, that is the moment that it hits them. That\u0026rsquo;s when they start remembering the moment that they hurt you. And that\u0026rsquo;s when they finally feel what you felt in real time.\nThis piece is the first to encounter when searching for what this term means. I find it very accurate to the point I feel discomfort that there is someone out there is able to describe me in words, to have the words and explanation that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have, that I was searching for almost my entire life. I can see my own patterns here, by distilling this piece:\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened This explains the selective ignorance that I adapt\nthey retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection, this explains many of my disappearances because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame, all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you,this explains my writing state of numbness When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone; this explains why I avoided establishing direct relationship (closeness), and decided to use society buckets On the harm I caused others For a long time I believed I\u0026rsquo;m just not build for relationships, the moment someone brings emotions to our conversation I pull away, there is this poor Jonior whom I met recently and the moment he told me: “you\u0026rsquo;re cool, I like you, we could be friends”,As soon as he said that, I completely withdrew. and vanished from his life. Earlier this year I was talking to my friend Omer Monir. on how I’ve abundant the idea of romantic relationships in my life. Due to reasons I failed to interpret at the time, but the idea of I myself avoiding it, is a huge factor. What scares me the most about all sorts of relationships is the closeness and the commitment it brings, I can\u0026rsquo;t show up everyday, I\u0026rsquo;m terrified and not familiar with the intimacy that comes with establishing relationships, I run, I pull away and I shut down emotionally the moment these start to happen,\nthis explains why I freaked out when recently one of the uni colleagues told me I\u0026rsquo;m their best friend, I froze, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what did I respond with, he was so polite when he added the words “but I understand that you\u0026rsquo;re always busy and you don\u0026rsquo;t text too much, but I know that you\u0026rsquo;re a good man”, I was left speechless, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t say a word, I felt the guilt of how I\u0026rsquo;m not able to love them back the way they loved me. but at the end a person will only love you to the capacity in which they\u0026rsquo;re able to love themselves. I\u0026rsquo;ve failed many people before; they were victims of my avoidance, This dialogue helps me to imagine the kind of stress I put those people under.\nI\u0026rsquo;m being too much, the replies are getting colder, shorter, it\u0026rsquo;s like they don\u0026rsquo;t even care at all anymore, now I\u0026rsquo;m starting to freak out, because the only person I wanna talk to, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m interrupting them or I\u0026rsquo;m disturbing them, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m a burden, like I\u0026rsquo;m unwelcomed. Did I do something wrong, am I pushing them away, because they are not giving me the same energy that they did, I just want them to notice, I just want them to remind me that I matter to them.\nI once wrote how I\u0026rsquo;m really not good at putting myself in the other people shoes , and how I fooled myself into thinking people won’t be affected by my own patterns but in reality, I have hurt people, a lot of them, and I keep hurting more, by avoiding them, by showing up randomly and disappear frequently. It’s a strange grief to realize the amount of wounded people not out of cruelty I exposed, but out of an instinct, a second nature I caught before I ever had the words for it. The grief is even harder to bear when thinking that some people didn’t walk away from me; they walked away from the waiting. From my patterns. I only learned the cost after the silence became permanent.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful that the things I wrote in the past are finally becoming clear to me. A lot of friends helped to see this part of myself, how avoidant I am, including my best friend AbdAlwahab, and a bunch of victims. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this to result in a behaviour change soon, but at least for now, I can recognize my own patterns. At least for now, everything made sense.\n","title":"Learning the Truth About How I Love","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/a_grief_i_didnt_expect/"},{"content":"This piece of writing was part of an article I’m writing, about how I would help someone answering the question of “what do I want to do”, where I discuss how to pick a major and what helps you to define the way you contribute to this world. I found the draft of the article to be very lengthy, I may expected the reader to be aware of difference notions upfront, so I preferred this topic to be referenced here. As many of my drafts are pointing to it.\nIntro I started by highlighting how chasing long horizon questions can lead to unnecessary complexity that you might not have the tooling to unpack currently\nIt is not in your interest to waste time on investigating how the educational system started and why I need to get a degree in the first place, but rather to admit and sign up to the terms and conditions of this life. It is in your interest to know how to make the best use of your free will, if it was not, by your parents or conditions, to choose what you want to do in life. That might, but not necessarily result in your enrollment in a related field at the university, considering a topic as your side hustle or ultimately your profession, more on this later.\nConsent to the game rules is what I love to call accepting how the systems work, and agreeing to the terms and conditions that are dictated by our modern societies and cultures. What I will count as an example is the generalist/polymath who would argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to pick a major, or they want to consume more than one major; this can result in abandoning the educational system or not taking it seriously. I will consume all arts and sciences until the line drawing these distinctions diminish, they say. Although this is a bold claim that no one dares to hold, people underestimate the amount of discipline they need to maintain in order to achieve what their perception wove.\nI always think of the American Constitution promoting the amendments about the division of labor that, in order for the nation/community to grow and help optimize the metrics for its greater good, economics, innovation, fast food, and the good things we have in our modern societies. People should be specialists.\nthis is more of a reality check that defines the way the world functions, if happens and you are one of those people buying the idea of being a generalist, I\u0026rsquo;m not telling you to drop the idea, but most importantly telling you you\u0026rsquo;re swimming against the odds by being a generalist, and that you need to make sure your good plan of becoming a generalist helps you and ultimately us in providing something meaningful to the world and it is not a recursion. not just illusions of being special. Although someone might argue that the future belongs to those who combine different skills, for now, this is an example of resistance in consenting to the game rules.\nConsenting to the game requires being able to make sense of why the world is the way it is, and to be ready to take off all the chains holding you back from starting to contribute to the world, wether this is despair of how much evil exists in the world, or confusion of how disorder the systems are, skepticism because if any of this real, or if my doings matter, these questions regarding the game of life need to be answered to finally consent with a rested heart after all the searching to the game rules.\nbut as you can see, most of these questions are philosophical, they are about meaning, existence, identity, things that you will naturally experience the moment you you\u0026rsquo;re conscious, others might require you to explore politics and economics, what you need to do is simple, to just believe in the idea of making tomorrow a better day, to Reduce your suffering. because this will help you in the pursuit of existential clarity, and will yield you will stamina to purse answers in different directions, this worth a standalone article but the gist of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying is, if you want to find answers to the questions you are having, you need to be good with whatever will serve you in making tomorrow a better day, the same way you are good with the language, out of its importance in describing the universe, you need to be good and welcome with the things that will minimize the complexity of your situations, having an initial faith you will be facing the game rules (The nonsense you don\u0026rsquo;t understand) and use it as instrument for better you. if this might still abstract I might indeed to write a standalone point.\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t be thriving and winning unless you stand and consent to the game rules. Staying the same and doing nothing will only make it worst, so we pick what is less painful; to get up and find answers, to contribute to humanity with what we will find.\nFinding Answers Some of these questions you need to answer in order to consent willingly to the game rules can take years, and this is definitely not the best case scenario, especially in your case, where you want more answers to forecast accurately. However, the best case scenario is to have the ability to be selectively ignorant,\nSelectively Ignorant If you can classify these kinda of questions that will drag you into an infinite loop, it is better to carry on your work by ignoring these questions and having their burden in the background, in the hope that they will be answered one day. This will help minimize the complexity of your decision-making. Selective ignorance is applied in different parts of my life; maybe I will write more about it in the future.\nThat Will do My second advice is not to overthink whether the answers you\u0026rsquo;ve got are optimal, or if it\u0026rsquo;s an answer that made you feel good. If it fits and helps you in the process of getting closer to start consenting to the game rules, then use them as placeholders. The unveiled insights and joy of consenting to the game are more rewarding than the value of time wasted searching for the optimal. Do not care about the sources, it can come from something minor as a random quoted message you read on some random street walls written by a heartbroken lover, that you will consider as the last piece of the puzzle, TEDx talk, discussion with a friend. university course, whether your sources were science, religion.

I hesitated to make new friendships , I hesitated to share my writings publicly .\nThe reason is I was, and to this very day concerned with the questions that deviated me from being socially active. One of these questions is:\nWhat happens to a young person’s expectations about life when most of what they see one the internet are idealized stories, overly wise, unrealistic narratives? What happens to my community if this is the kind of discussion being shared publicly, which is mostly unproductive, pointless, trivial, and hollow? Can I change this?\nI\u0026rsquo;m still young, actively consuming data from the world, learning, and constantly changing. Sharing my opinions is not making the world a better place, I\u0026rsquo;m sure whatever I write be deprecated by my constantly evolving beliefs . so why bother writing? the world has enough of people talking, saying they want to make it a better place. The world is full of people who are more \u0026ldquo;qualified\u0026rdquo; to talk than myself although no one listens to them. Writing random quotes on social media that can mean different things to different people, or sharing a meme that can help someone heal, was enough for me.\nThis hides the part of my life I don\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable revealing in lengthy stories and lessons. The problem is that the majority of people end up using social media as a self help book. They look up to people\u0026rsquo;s achievements to get inspired, craving stories that match their personal circumstances and challenges. People are subconsciously building a map about the world using what is shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X…\nAn example: someone doubting their journey in learning finance، feeling lost in the equations, thinking they’re \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo; because everyone else seems to master the math effortlessly and even automate process in software tools. What people don’t say is that doubt is normal, and many of these equations aren’t intuitive at all, hardly understood at any given time. and It’s okay to feel confused Another example . someone just learning software engineering opens LinkedIn and feels left behind because people post about how they can solve noble problems using data science and machine learning software 2.0 they say. They may feel others are more impactful, and build the statement \u0026ldquo;all people working in data science are impactful\u0026rdquo; while in reality, most of these are demo projects, graduation projects, or research ideas far from implementation. I experienced the same when I first accessed the internet, consuming materials that seemed ideal, perfect, true, valid ,but are far from reality.\nNot explicitly mentioning our imperfections, hiding them, does not help. Packaging them in memes, stories, or art might provide temporary comfort and company for someone receiving, but it might not be good in the long run. I see this as one of the factors contributing to people\u0026rsquo;s despair these days. We tend to package our social appearance with what we find worth showing. Of course, you won\u0026rsquo;t go out there showing people all the insecurities you have. Telling them how you overcome social anxiety, they believe its a myth, or how awkward your hobbies are, you will be judged harshly. A few people do this. But in searching for perfection, we forget the most natural attributes of being human: being present , being emotional, being wrong.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m about to talk publicly or post on social media, I overthink if my writing matches all backgrounds and ages of my audience, if people would think I\u0026rsquo;m insecure about something, and if my writing is solid. That\u0026rsquo;s why I mostly write short quotes, not sharing experiences, lessons, or opinions, and ultimately suppressing my emotions.\nLife isn’t a set of solutions Life isn\u0026rsquo;t made up of a set of solutions for you to find.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built on extreme behaviors you learn to balance.\nAs a result of not engaging fully socially I have mastered controlling and potentially suppressing my emotions; which led to numbness . eventually I lost the meaning and pleasure of sharing my experience. the silence of surviving a day that no one knew about was hard, but the comfort zone I build covered this. Other factors include I\u0026rsquo;m very good at keeping myself busy and having master\u0026rsquo;s degree in wearing custom masks. By letting myself speak more honestly, I’m not only helping myself grow; I’m giving something back to the people who read me. If I share things as they are not polished, not idealized I might open a small space for someone else to breathe, to doubt safely, to feel normal again. And maybe this is how I contribute: not by being perfect, but by being real when most people aren’t.\nNow, I need to learn the opposite: I need to engage, to care. I need to feel and to love. To enhance the quality of my life, I must show my true colors without abandoning myself.\nI must stop wearing masks and let the changes that happen to me show up in my behavior with people. This way I can know who truly loves me and whose concerns include my problems.\nPerfect time does not exist if you wait, until everything feels finished, you gonna miss the people who would have loved you exactly as you are.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve waited for a long time to get it right, to feel certain that I finally figured it all out. That I will have a good map of reality which can define ideal human interactions for me. But this never happened, and I might waste my life waiting. And planning.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give this a shot I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to read books, rush the process of writing and publicly sharing, spend hours consulting friends, and form smaller communities to test my ideas. Did they work? Not entirely, but they provided lessons and information. I have no clue if this is just one of those random 3:00 AM bursts of motivation or if I’m finally tired of my own patterns, but one thing is sure: life rewards actions more than intelligence. I have a preliminary outline of what I want to do, and I should not overthink and drown myself in inaction. I will fail, it\u0026rsquo;s okay. I\u0026rsquo;m freaking out while writing this, but the signs point me to try. I will share more because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. Sharing my uncertainty can help someone; sharing my doubts when learning something can make someone\u0026rsquo;s day better. Sharing my insecurities can bring me people who help me overcome them.\nIn the end Having these pieces of notions connected and understood took me a long time. Yesterday, I was vulnerable, unaware of what I write here. My writing is not perfect; I could have used wiser words. Blind spots, potential mistakes, and pitfalls await me, but I welcome them, and I welcome whoever helps me in my journey.\nFor what is a man what has he got If not himself then he has not To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way.\n","title":"Learning to Feel Again","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/learning_to_feel_again/"},{"content":"I had a friend I met online who struggled with social anxiety. He used to tell me how he panicked at the idea of going to the university. I knew he wasn’t lying, but part of me couldn’t truly believe it, that a psychological disorder could control someone that much. I was telling him: you just needed to stop overthinking that people will hurt you, remind yourself there’s no reason to be afraid, and call it a day. Yes, I was ignorant. I tried to convince him to change something he couldn’t change, to “overcome it,” as if these were only voices in his head.\nIn 2022, I joined the University of Khartoum. I enjoyed the first few weeks before I flew out of the country and returned only for the first semester exam. like any freshman, I spent that first year in exploration, even though I was mostly abroad and only came back for exams and a few short periods.I was just given access to all sorts of materials. I just got good at googling things, MIT lectures, practical sessions, philosophy, logic, debates, activities. I wasn’t extreme/insane compared to people who signed up for every program and consumed whatever their eyes landed on, but I was selectively adding to my curiosity bucket, which happened to be very large. At that time, I was a firm believer in “having the skills” rather than just scanning books, which of course didn’t make me a healthy intellectual out of me, not the kind with good habits and healthy shape. No, it did quite the opposite. It put my health at risk.\nI had early signs that something bad was about to happen. I even mentioned this to my friend Kenyata , telling him how much I lack entertainment and simple enjoyment in my life. I was in Morocco at the time, I told him that when I return back to Sudan, I wanted to explore life a bit, pause from the grind, and see what people did outside academics and work. I told him I planned to try different restaurants. And honestly the reason I wanted to have a pause was that, my brother had been asking about my social life. He somehow convinced me it was important for my health to go outside, socialize and meet some friends. I took his advice seriously because he’s an introvert like me, and I hoped that piece of wisdom came from his own experience. But when I came back, I overloaded myself with even more tasks. I consumed even more material, aggressively. The social promise I made to my brother vanished, and I completely forgot the need to entertain myself.\nI remember that day clearly, the night before was long I spend the whole night awake and went into the exam without any rest, it was a calculus exam so you can imagine the amount of preparation I needed to put. after the exam, I went to the Computer Science department building at the faculty (the one basically colonized by IT students) for a reason I can’t even remember. I was somewhere in the middle of the first staircase. and without any premises I felt I was dying.\nI experienced a tunnel vision , I felt I was isolated from the world, My heart started beating so fast for no reason, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel normal at all. I was shocked to the point I could barely breath, I was lucky that the stairs had a handrail I can hold onto, I slowly made my way to the building\u0026rsquo;s entrance, where some seniors noticed there is something wrong with me, I\u0026rsquo;ve asked them to bring me water and mango juice (Maza) for some reason, maybe I thought it was a sugar problem. I was carried to what I think was the network admins office or something similar where I rested but my heart couldn\u0026rsquo;t slow down. Thankfully a girl from my batch called Esraa saw me and stood stayed with me stood by since,\nI was taken to the hospital, where they put all those sensors to my chest and ran different scans and tests. After about half an hour of that relentless, heavy heartbeat, my heart finally slowed down. I expected nothing less than a stroke or some kind of heart condition. I even had this dramatic thoughts that I might die from heartbreak for reasons I had woven in my head. I thought, This must be it.\nSurprisingly, all the scans were clean. I remember the doctor telling me my heart was “like a horse’s heart,” and that I didn’t have any heart disease. Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the horse\u0026rsquo;s heart analogy I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less, but It was a relief, although I was too mentally overwhelmed to process anything. I never followed up with the doctors to understand exactly what happened. My family arrived and took me home. My sister Zeinab, who is a doctor, told me it was a panic attack and explained what that meant. I watched some videos about it including this TEDx video I remember clearly, and I immediately related to it. I also joined online support groups and found comfort in hearing other people’s stories.\nI was healing from this accident by listening to the stories of people who experienced the same thing. Knowing that others had gone through similar circumstances that I wasn’t alone was reasonable to me to relief. But I never looked into why I was triggered in the first other than knowing “stress can lead you here, and it will reoccur when you trigger it again.”\nI eventually noticed a pattern: I felt discomfort whenever I was at the university. I remember this day very distinctly where I wanted any excuse not to go there. And luckily for me, the car I used to drive had almost no gas, and I wasn’t planning to stand in a long fuel queue. For but for some reason, though, I decided to go using public transportation, first a city train, then a bus. While crossing the bridge, Kobry Alhadeed, I started getting anxious. I felt afraid. And the closer I got to the university, the more scared I became. I can’t remember the lectures from that day, but it was the day I confirmed the pattern.\nWhat shocked me was what happened after the lectures. A friend told me he wanted to pick something up from the Computer Science department building and asked me to walk with him before we return back home.I found myself standing in front of the entrance, and my stress levels were extreme. I couldn’t enter the building. That’s when I knew: this was the thing I feared. I was afraid that if I entered that building again, something would happen to me.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the building is officially the “CS Department,” but it’s mostly used for IT lectures. Since I’m a computer science student, I was never required to be there, I had no courses inside that building. But I used to go there anyway because many of our friends had lectures there and were always hanging out. What I didn’t realize is that I had been avoiding it the entire time without noticing. I didn’t enter that building again until the course finished.\nWriting this now triggered me a bit. It seems that building really freak me out the most. While I was fighting these internal battles with panic attacks, the symptoms started to manifest as IBS. I thought it was genetic, most of my family has it, but my sister told me mine was caused by stress, and because you were very stressed recently, the IBS decided to accompany you. And she was right, the conversations I had with Kenyata about pausing the grind, was because a very subtle, inner voice was whispering to me, you need to take rest, but because I was exploring and the dopamine was always high, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t notice that I was under stress, stress that I love doing, stress out of things I loved, I later learned that even the things you love can make you sick, but it was too late. I noticed I only experienced the symptoms when I was stressed, not when I ate garbage food.\nDuring that period, a sudden shift hit my social life, it changed suddenly. I couldn’t hold conversations longer than a minute. I avoided people, especially the ones I knew well. I felt that if I talked too much, I would die. And I mean that literally, that’s how it felt. Talking to people I knew became the scariest thing ever. Almost everyone in my batch noticed. “Ahmed has changed.” Some even sat with me and asked what was going on. I’m not sure what I told them, but I’m sure I said something like, “everything is fine”, because I had no words to describe what I was going through.\nAnd suddenly, I had social anxiety. Me? Ahmed? the guy who initiated our batch group chat, who was nominated to be the batch representative, who used to be public and comfortable speaking. I wasn’t afraid of people. And now I had social anxiety? It was hard to believe. It was a dramatic shift. My online friend the one I used to make fun of when he told me he had social anxiety, I was slowly beginning to understand him, and to understand how ignorant I had been. I never imagined a day would come when my thoughts would no longer control my body.\nI was skeptical. I made several assumptions to explain what I was experiencing. The first was returning to the idea that I actually had a heart disease, because all the discomfort was happening in my chest and around my heart. The second was that I might be bewitched or cursed somehow. And the third was that it was a punishment from God, because I had once thought my friend was exaggerating his condition, and making things up. Between those assumptions, I was lost. I genuinely didn’t know what was happening to me.\nA new fear was unlocked during that time. where I went to picnic and I met some friends some of them for the first time, it is common in Sudan, we greeted each other with hugs, before handshakes. I remember seeing the first group of friends, and before we even hugged, my body was signaling that I should run, that I shouldn’t let anyone touch me. I\u0026rsquo;m someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like physical interactions, but not to the point of being terrified of it. I didn’t want this. I forced myself to hug them “normally”, and of course I didn’t die, but my stress levels was even higher than when I stood in front of the CS department building. At that moment, I believed for sure that I was bewitched. There was no way, that someone can get stressed and feel like they might die from hugging a friend, someone I should have been happy to see.\nAfter about two hours, another group of friends arrived, and when it came time for the hugging thing again, I partially fainted and fell to the ground. My friend Mustafa sensed my heartbeat; it was beating to the max. I don’t remember the exact dialogue, but they gave me something to drink and eat. And then I was fine again. They were confused because my explanations weren\u0026rsquo;t clear; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear to me either.\nI don’t remember a lot from that period because too many things were happening at once. But I do remember that after that picnic, I stopped meeting people entirely. I skipped university for several days. And it wasn’t long after that when the war started. To this day, I still can’t fully understand why all of this happened. But at least I evaluated my assumptions: I have came to the realization I wasn’t bewitched. After about eight months, I went back to working out and running, and being able to do those things easily, without any heart issues, boosted my confidence that I didn’t have a heart disease.\nI was gradually disappearing from people\u0026rsquo;s life, I had no motivation to talk to people, I have more things that are telling me not to connect with people, I mean if just hugs are doing this to do. lol, Looking back, I see many people who have no explanation for why I disappeared from their lives, why my behavior changed so drastically. Things weren’t good even before the war they were getting worse, but at least they eventually led me to understand that stress was the cause, even when I couldn’t feel the stress itself. One of the strange, almost funny stories from that time: several weeks after the incident, the right side of my face became completely paralyzed. I couldn’t move it at all. I went to the hospital, they diagnosed me with Bell’s palsy , a condition where the facial nerve on one side of the face suddenly stops working. And of course I was bewitched, of all the diseases that I know, I was given a weird paralysis in the face, someone must have wanted to torture me. After reading more about it, I learned that stress can also cause it. I rested my heart by saying, Stress is the cause.\nI remember I landed an internship but only went onsite for a total of three days. I remember barely speaking to my best friends during that entire period. I don’t remember much about how things were at home either, but I’m sure I kept myself constantly busy. Those days affected almost every part of my life. I tend to have a weaker memory for the bad times, but what I’ve written here are the extremes, the moments I simply couldn’t forget. The belief that I always had control over my mind and my body, that I can act as a commander was a heaven that I only realized when I lost control, when my mind and body turned against me. I was afraid that people would see me as vulnerable, I was afraid that with all this stress adding more and more complexity to my life, that I would be dependent on someone, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be burden. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to know that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ok.\n","title":"Days That I Don’t Understand","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/days_that_i_didnt_understand/"},{"content":"The velocity at which I\u0026rsquo;m updating my beliefs about the world has never been known to be slow; saying \u0026ldquo;Oops\u0026rdquo; and updating my beliefs implies updating my behavior if needed.

I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.\nSean, Good Will Hunting (Park Bench Scene)\nAlthough my previous blog post was expected to be an explanation of what I assumed to be something I adopted a long time ago and never updated before:\nbut I have never revised the list since a while\nAdding new friends system I never expected the system to be perfect, or that I was doing what is ultimately right. The reason why I felt I should be listing this legacy system of adding new friends by writing the blog post , is because I felt it was the time to rethink it. I wasn’t explicit about this, (meaning it took me time to realize that I really need to rethink it.), but I felt this shouldn’t continue. The case analysis is not as good as it used to be in helping classifying people, many cases violated the rules, but the system still pulls me back to use its methods. [!IMPORTANT] I will be using the terms system and legacy system interchangeably. The term legacy system refers to an outdated but still functional computer system, software, or hardware that continues to be used because it performs its original, essential tasks, even as newer technologies emerge.\n[!NOTE] I deliberately selected the term value when saying assigning the name “Friend”, because it is not just a word, I consider it a value. Calling you a friend adds the values that require me to “allow myself to fall, to invest my emotions.”\nby this elboration I hope to clear the misconceptions that might accure from my previous writing, it build on top of the previous blog post Adding new friends system , you might want to take a look if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. this conversation will particularly discuss the cases where the system is not good enough, why I was still using it?, how it is so bad to the people who should be friends.\nWhy so many rules? Life is meant to be simple. There are many levels to look into why I don’t actually find it hard to rank people.one is Checklist based thinking happens everywhere, by everyone. First impressions are a sort of ranking system, and most people don’t take any effort in check listing their candidates, because it happens in the background of their minds, embedded just like first impressions.\nThe same happens to me, except that I might be using more rigorous tests. So I’m not really adding logic to the equation of life, it’s already there.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m not really walking around ranking people according to my checklist of what I favor, it is my mind that blocks me from transcending a relationship beyond what it is, unless it satisfies what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. this can act as a reason for why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so urgent about changing it, because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really suffering from it, it is something that happens almost naturally.\nAll the cool friends I could’ve made When establishing relationships, it is almost always the case that I don\u0026rsquo;t assign the value friend to them easily, lets call these people \u0026ldquo;candidates\u0026rdquo;, The best scenario is to have candidates who don’t care whether I gave this title to them or not; they don’t even ask about it. They see that I’m doing my best to match their energy.\nbut you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should\nAdding new friends system We’re supposed to enjoy the relationship without hindrance. I would do a great job at this, they would know I’m someone who never minds spending quality time with them, that I respect them, and am always happy to see them. Until they start to investigate their role within me too early.\nAnd if this happens, they won’t like it. They’ll translate me not adding them to the “friends” list as being heartless, as though they’re the ones taking part in the relationship, not me.\nI’d love if the universe worked according to my rules: why care about titles when I’m already there for you? But in the end, it’s not their fault. I shouldn’t have adopted this system in the first place, let alone explaining its creepiness to people or expecting them to understand it.\nHandling the misconceptions about “I will magically force myself to never invest emotions in the relationship” will take part shortly in this post, but for now, remember that the legacy system seemed to work for what I wanted it to do.\nhowever it does a greater job preventing “bad friends“. It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends) and this is where it helps me the most.\nAdding new friends system As long as it helps me make friends, and provides the definitions and rules of human interaction to me, I have no problem using it. But the real question is: why am I still using this legacy system?\nElaborating on the effects but there are downsides you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself.\nAdding new friends system Yes, I control the amount of love I stream toward someone/candidate, even if they were perfect candidates. I won’t send them any signals that strengthen our bond. I’ll avoid them. I’ll do what it takes to not invest emotion, and I’m good at it.\nI only stream what I think is sufficient to match their energy. The real downside is when this loop continues. They feel the walls I’m building hindering the relationship, and at that particular point I get disturbed.\nAt this stage, the best scenario is to respect the walls and plan to tear them down over time (though sometimes they’re never meant to be broken).\n1. Leakage in the system. In theory, I get to decide that I will not invest emotions, by controlling the amount of lets say love I stream for someone (love implies trust), just as computational theories ignore practical constraints, but in practice, emotions are not precisely controlled; they leak easily\n2. a double-edged sword. it is very common that I lose potential good friends in the process, and that hurts, seeing cool people leave. they realize how hard it is to deal with me, and then stop trying.\nThis cycle of people showing genuine interest in me, then suddenly losing it, is hard. It happened when I wasn’t aware that I had so many walls, that people aren’t good at climbing them. I was ignorant, selfish, not giving guidance on how to approach me.\nThinking it’s your thing to figure me out, who did I think I was? King Richard the Fifth? May I never trust my judgment again.\n3. But I\u0026rsquo;m hurt 2. What once felt unbearable to remember now feels necessary to recall. This one almost slipped out of memory, but when I lost those potential cool “friends,” I wasn’t happy about it. I remember now that I didn’t like it at all.\nI felt destined to live alone, not knowing I was drowning by my own design. I was too young to realize this. And instead of revising the list of rules I set to add new friends, to make them less rigorous, I fed it even more.\nWhy the legacy system is still in production Besides the system doing its job, there were boosters that helped keep it running.\nLet go before they let go:\nThe cycle of people entering and leaving my life left a scar. I started letting go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself caused these bad experiences to accumulate. It taught me that people leave, so I began preemptively leaving first.\n“People will stop trying to know you, you piece of shit. You’re setting the walls so high they won’t even try to climb them.” telling myself. And I had no idea that it was me causing this. That’s how two insecurities start boosting each other.\nThe legacy system is not helping me establishing new friendships (pending status cases). People are letting go of me because of this embedded legacy system. I let go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself helps me in the process of letting go of the people The legacy system says \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re anxious that they might leave you. I can help you to get rid of them preemptively.\u0026rdquo; The system rewards me by \u0026ldquo;either way, they might have been bad friends or they didn\u0026rsquo;t pass the tests\u0026rdquo;. man screw the tests.\nin short this monster was feeding itself. and apparently me.\nIrresistible features:\nMy sister once made an observation during a family discussion about our dark past selves. She noticed that growing up (me), I had access to the bad world, with tons of potential bad friends I could’ve made, but I chose not to.\nThe system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, actual true negatives, the ones that really would’ve hurt me. The problem is, it also keeps making false positives: rejecting people who were good, who could’ve stayed. It convinces me that losing them was just self protection,Though it’s hard to take the burden of \u0026ldquo;controlling the stream of love towards someone\u0026rdquo;, it’s also hard to be stabbed in the back. The system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, There was no other way, it was either being armed with it or being naïve and cut by friends.\nI’m good at keeping myself busy:\nThe legacy system not only controls how much love I give to people, it controls how many people I give it to.\nThose I call friends rarely exceed five or ten. I keep myself busy, which limits how many interactions I can manage. I’ve learned I don’t need to make a friend in every new country or city I live in, not doing so doesn’t kill me.\nI manage the few friends I have very well. They give me more than enough. I don’t plan to have many friends, it’s not aligned with my social energy or resources. The legacy system is good at controlling that number. It’s a win-win.\nAnswers not found elsewhere:\nSometimes I think about dismantling the system and moving on, but questions arise:\nHow do I prevent wounds if I step outside my walls?\nHow do I define friendship as something prestigious and not instantly given?\nThe first fence in the system is crucial, it helps control the number of people in my life. I can’t be friends with everyone I meet; I’d end up with too many.\nQuestions the legacy system fails to answer Some questions the system simply can’t answer well:\nWhat should I do if they figure it out?\nPeople go through painful ups and downs during the “pending” phase. They lose meaning in establishing a relationship once they realize they’re not assigned a value yet.\nI wasn’t trained to trust people this fast, but it’s not right to keep them hanging. The system doesn’t guide me here: should I explain it? Should I force myself to love them or assign the value they deserve?\nWhat should I do with pending requests?\nSome people are never meant to enter, I prefer keeping walls between us. The system doesn’t provide guidance.\nI remember a friend, culturally a friend, but I never really invested in him. He was great, but I didn’t want to allow myself to fall into that bond. Poor him, what did he have to do with my hormones? Again, the system didn’t help.\n404 Not Found:\nSometimes I fail to migrate relationships outside the scope of the greater good , that shared purpose that once connected us.\nI meet cool people in cool places; we like each other. But once the shared context is gone, I can’t find a new reason to stay connected.\nOutside the greater good:\nSome people are great under the scope of a project or purpose, but outside it, I can’t find what links us. Their attempts get pended.\nUndefined “something”:\nothertimes its more specific cases, For example, someone once part of my team, ideally female, wanted to get to know me outside of that shared goal. “Female friend”? I have no definition for that. How should I act? I don’t know, but I’ll definitely run away from anything undefined, lol.\nIf this isn’t your case, good for you. Some people don’t suffer from basic questions like deciding whether to make someone a friend or not. But I do, not enough to urgently change, but enough to notice it.\nI can still approach people, create one sided friendships, get what I need, make them smile, make them do what I want gently, wish them well, and support their wins.\nMost importantly, I can keep myself busy enough to avoid looking too closely at my malfunctioning legacy system.\ntoday! I’ve unlocked a hidden insecurity that’s been operating subconsciously, one I partly knew existed but never realized how much it was feeding other insecurities.\nThis moment of self-awareness feels like progress. I just need to unlearn it now. It might take years, but I’ve begun.\n","title":"Elaborate: Adding New Friends System","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"I get asked:\nHow do you deal with ordinary people? The ones that don\u0026rsquo;t bother you? and when does it start that they enter your life?\nThis question has got me thinking. I recalled that checklist (set of rules) I have for making new friends, but I have never revised the list for a while. I have seen cases where people just hack the system, and suddenly they are knocking on the door of my heart before even check-listing half of it.\nThe set of rules I have adapted is simple enough to help me make new friends; however, it does a greater job preventing “bad friends.” It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends), and this is where it helps me the most. More about it later; first, let’s get to see where this starts.\nIn elementary school, I made the observation that most people around me complain about how they were betrayed, stabbed in the back, or any sort of resentment that happened to them, caused by relationships, particularly friendships. To make sense of why they suffer, my observation was: “All these people you were hurt by, you had positive feelings about them; you loved them.\u0026quot; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be in such a position, so I learned through preaching to myself.\nthe equation was obvious to me: \u0026ldquo;the more emotions I invest in someone, the deeper the wound is,\u0026rdquo; and you start investing emotions in people the moment you assign them the name \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; in your head. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall this equation resulting in me being afraid of making friendships, but what I did was to learn from them. What I learned is that many cases were wounded because they were too early in assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the people they met.\nAs social creatures, we tend to make friendships in the new places or paths we take (new school, new university, new habit…) or sometimes when we feel lonely, or even worse, when we are too optimistic. However, these reasons do not respect the slow pace needed for making friendships; they are in a rush. For example, a fresher might feel either very overwhelmed by the number of questions they got, so they try to establish friendships (either to feel no guilt if people also turn out not to have answers, or to have answers), or very energized by the amount of sudden freedom they were never granted before, and they want to make friends to do all sorts of crazy things they want to do. So whether your reasons were noble (work on study groups, research, projects, politics) or less impactful (host parties, go to the park), they are all tagged with urgency. Of course, you can\u0026rsquo;t wait two years to make a friend.\nFor these very reasons, \u0026ldquo;bad friends\u0026rdquo; happen, that we needed to call someone a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; we had tons of emotions that couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold their horses and needed someone to run for.\nHow I planned to overcome this? Simply don\u0026rsquo;t call people your \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; I haven’t used that term for as long as I can remember. My very first friend, I was telling myself about \u0026ldquo;Wow, this guy has done so much for me. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to call him a friend, then I\u0026rsquo;m selfish and heartless\u0026rdquo;. What people don\u0026rsquo;t understand is that I still had a quality time with that guy without calling him a friend. I was enjoying my life with them, and I was making memories.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve applied what happened with the first person I ever admitted by heart as a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the friends I met down the road, is to never call them friends until time passes and they prove they are trustworthy.\nIf you keep saying everyone is your friend, you will end up wounded alot.\nBut there are downsides, you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you are going to be in defense mode all the time (or it is not that bad; maybe you will get used to it), but you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should. But don\u0026rsquo;t call them friends, not yet, because the moment you start assigning them the value \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; you allow yourself to invest more emotions (trust, love, loyalty…). If you have an argument saying friendship should not be that hard, and at the start I don\u0026rsquo;t really allow myself to fall completely, then this is good for you, but for me, no. Assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to people means a lot more, so I don\u0026rsquo;t give it away that easily. Luckily, society gave us names as placeholders for people that even can help define the interactions and limits of relationships to have with people: there are Coworkers, Neighbors, Classmates, Colleagues, Managers, Team members, Collaborators, Customers, Clients, Students, Teachers, and even Mutuals (your friend\u0026rsquo;s friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be your friend). Why don\u0026rsquo;t people use these? They are good, they protect you, they help you.\nGoing back to our discussion, the reason why I want to revise my set of rules for making new friends as mentioned before is that there seem to be people who violate the rules. They are just cool enough to make friendships with; they can\u0026rsquo;t stay just \u0026ldquo;people,\u0026rdquo; they need to be \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; And they already have the same amount of admiration as my friends, but I\u0026rsquo;m yet to call them \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; This nonsense happens for a lot of reasons; let\u0026rsquo;s list some:\nThe experiences I went through in making friends were very long in terms of duration, and this is purely by chance. My very first friends took a long time to call them friends — years. This was reflected in some way in my subsequent experiences (I started to consider taking more time just as how my first friendships took more time to bond). This might be nonsense, but that means even if someone passed the checklist in under six months, and they were finally qualified to be \u0026ldquo;friends,\u0026rdquo; without a year or two passing by, I can\u0026rsquo;t call them friends.\nIn simple terms, the way I formed friendship was that I get to know people very slowly and we disappear for years in the middle. This reflected that I don\u0026rsquo;t make people friends easily.\nAnother reason is to be mindful of the greater good we are serving. This is very common in relationships of University and Work because there is often a greater purpose that must be served and is compromised the moment we call ourselves \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; A good example would be a woman called Samar Yahia. Samar ages me by about ten years. We were co-founders of a startup at some point, and we just met. I never knew who she was, she knew who I am, and we never met to this very day although we live in the same city. Why? Simply because we prioritize the greater good of the startup by being co-founders/co-workers. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a great time; we had amazing conversations, laughter, we shared experiences and life lessons, we allowed ourselves to enjoy the process, and never made it boring. But let\u0026rsquo;s just not take it to the next level of being friends even if it feels right. If I ever get the chance to meet Samar in an alternative world, we would have been great friends, or if we had something other than work.\nThe last one is that I want to protect either myself or someone by not going to be a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; and it is better to have walls between. An example would be: Ahmed is a cool new freshman at the university, and I want to take him under my wings by making friendship with him, aka investing emotions. But I might not do that. Although he passed the checklist and is now a good candidate, I might prefer to keep the default relationship (colleague) assigned to him. Why? Well, since he is too young, I’m not sure if by this sudden access to all sorts of amusement and ideologies, he will remain the one I hoped to make friendship with. This way I can protect myself from making friendships with Ahmed. Another pattern that happens a lot, is the other way around: University colleagues try to get to know me outside the University, and they are often pushed by walls I build to protect them from me. I don’t want them to invest their emotions in me because I don’t see myself as trustworthy, that I\u0026rsquo;m not someone they can really rely on, and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust myself to handle that responsibility, at least not yet. This way, I protect them (and many times hurt them) using the walls I build and keeping them away from my friends zone, and most importantly, keep myself away from their friends zone.\nAt the end, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just a traumatized kid formalizing all these rules to make friendship. In reality, I don\u0026rsquo;t really suffer from this. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m good at reaching out to people and making friendships. I don\u0026rsquo;t struggle to communicate with people or get what I want. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a bad time searching for quality time. And thinking about how much worse it could be without these rules, I remind myself to be grateful.\nWhat kind of walls do you mean exactly?\nThe first one, I assume, is to act ordinary (which is a product of the walls but it\u0026rsquo;s just the first fence), acting ordinary is to not reveal the basic information about me, my name, my age, what I do in life. But this layer is fragile, once I\u0026rsquo;m asked, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind answering, it helps me save time and avoid making unnecessary relationships, I can\u0026rsquo;t count the amount of cool and bad people I could have made in life if I had never had this first wall which I now call the fence (it assumes acting dumb while knowing, being nonchalant while I\u0026rsquo;m a bit interested(this one started to fading recently I gotta get my shit together), sharing misguided information about me).\nThe most important wall is the privacy wall. I only allow a certain amount of information to get leaked from what I\u0026rsquo;m doing in my life. What I want to do. I\u0026rsquo;m not giving or sharing what violates my privacy. this includes (my family, my moves, my trips, my quality time, my free time, my friends, my performance, my upside-downs)\nless in height, subtle insecurities I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to involve people in.\n","title":"Adding new friends system","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"To nerd out and talk about a particular topic that you are deeply interested in/ obsessed with, requires you to unveil part of yourself. Your personality, your affection, your love for that topic. Often, it feels like dancing in the symphony of that subject(my analogy is very consumed, but I feel it holds true here).\nWhile jumping between discussions on Substack , I found myself watching this Kurt Vonnegut lecture.\nWatch the lecture Although I enjoyed the whole presentation, I was most impressed by his performance in the final minutes, the way he left the stage, his funny moves and gestures. This wasn’t unique to the ending, though. The way he spoke and carried himself throughout the lecture was “unique.”\nUnique to him.\nIt felt like this was how his soul interpreted information or felt about it, how it reacted to the joy of sharing his inner reasoning and experiences. You could sense the years of thought and accumulation behind every word. The jokes, the gestures, the rhythm, they were all expressions of his love for what he was saying.\nI found myself imagining a kind of paradise around the idea that he was never ashamed of being himself. Because when you look at him, he was doing weird stuff, awkward moves, overly specific jokes, yet the audience loved it. They understood and accepted his (uniqueness soon will be called awkwardness). They even craved it.\nuniqueness is just him being true to himself, acting natural and manifesting what he feels in the way he likes\nif this uniqueness exists in an alternative world, a world where he couldn’t be himself freely, where his natural self would be judged as strange akward. where his uniqueness is akwardness.\nWatching him leave the stage while everyone clapped, appreciating what he had shared, reminded me of how many intellectuals from my country travel abroad to pursue their careers in the United States or other Western nations that seem to value what they can offer.\noften saying,\nMy skills were welcomed in the country of Uncle Sam.\nThis isn’t about how the United States has built the perfect habitats for nerds and anyone who wants to be themselves; by embracing people as they are and shaping social norms around tolerance, rather than judgment.\nIt’s more about how bad I feel coming from regions where being your true self is misunderstood, misused, and simpy is a crime.\nAt that particular moment, watching him leave the stage, I remembered how unlucky we are for not growing up in environments that encourage us to nerd out, to share the things we are obsessed with in our own way, or even to share them at all.\nYou don’t know how many times I’ve tried to have deep discussions with people who are truly good at something(they are nerds about particular subject), just to crack through their insecurities and show them:\n“I’m a good listener. I won’t judge. Only love. I won’t be freaked out by your awkwardness. I’m more interested in hearing you express your passion naturally, not formally or shyly. You know you’re obsessed with it deep down — and there’s no reason to feel guilty about that with me.”\nCracking those defense walls is never easy.\nAnd it’s not their fault.\nIt’s the world they were born into, one that never prioritized who they truly are.\n","title":"Where You Are Allowed To Be You","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/where_you_are_allowed_to_be_you/"},{"content":"When making decisions in life, especially when we are faced with selecting between two events, we find ourselves comparing how important they are in order to determine which event we should choose. Some people study the implications of each decision and measure how rewarding or penalizing the outcomes might be. Picking the least penalty is a tactic for choosing a decision under this scenario.\nI first encountered this three years ago in one of Jeff Bezos’s interviews. he called it the Regret Minimization Framework. This tactic can be used on a smaller scale, even in daily decisions like getting out of bed or not. I’m sure you’ve used this tactic today in your own decision making process as a kind of mental tool. Usually, it helps me clarify priorities and take action with confidence. But what I’m here to share is a funny story: for the very first time, I was unable to use this utility in my decision making process.\nTwo events were taking place in the same hour block the next morning (8:00 AM). To make a decision, I defaulted my brain to use the regret minimization method. Unfortunately, the two events were equally likely in their consequences, at least from what my mind could list. Of course, life can have consequences that shows the advantages of one selection over the another, but I’m yet to know this and I need to make decisions under what I only know, and able to consider at the particular time I’m given this.\nIt felt exactly like how mathematical reasoning falls apart when dividing by zero, or how classical physics fails to explain things at small scales. This dilemma, of having two equally important events with either equally likely outcomes or vague consequences, made the regret minimization method fail completely. And honestly, that was a funny realization, because I’m rarely hesitant in making decisions. I know exactly what if I want to make a decision over another.\nMaybe I expected too much from this method,or misused it,but that’s not really the point I want to highlight. Perhaps this reflection doesn’t offer a grand piece of wisdom, but you can still take something from it: explore new ways of making decisions in your own life. Experiment with frameworks or tactics that help you choose the optimal option more often. And most importantly, pick an option, don’t stay up until (3:42 AM) like me, still undecided and unable to sleep.\n","title":"The Limits of the Regret Minimization Framework","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_limits_of_the_regret_minimization_framework/"},{"content":" Everyone is atheist until the plane starts falling. I have no clue who said this.\nThe numerous different stories that act as catalysts for returning to God and thinking about the existence of a grand designer or creator, shared by people across the globe, are interesting. There are a variety of patterns, and often the most interesting ones are those concluded through epistemic rationality rather than convenience or bias—where there was evidence that God existed, for them. One pattern is how God existed in everyday life. A good example is the historical belief that the creation of all temples and religions around the world throughout history is an innate, lowkey, subtle need for God.\nAnd this is what I’m interested in pulling strings from and building upon—what I felt right before I sleep. I’m not diving into theology, but rather sharing a concept I just coined: “Gratitude Register.” This is what I assume as the “where I find God” in my “everyday life pattern.” No matter what beliefs I’m holding or how religious or spiritual I am at a particular point in time, at the end of the day (literally) I find myself accounting for what was good today and in my life. This happens by default; it’s the way your psyche validates the day, your memory works, and you yourself try to make sense of all the nonsense you were doing throughout the day. Depending on how I define good (which of course includes biased beliefs or definitions from religion), I can bring different combinations of them. Now, if these things outweigh the misfortunes I have, that means it is a good day (again, there is no agreed upon way of defining and measuring misfortunes). Hence, some positive feelings may start to appear—one that stands out so loudly is gratitude. This feeling is a well known visitor, outshining others through its powerful urge.\nGratitude: “I’m here.” Translation: I’m grateful. Gratitude: “I need to make a decision so fast (urge).” Translation: I need to be grateful “for someone.”\nTranslation is what the mind tells about the chemicals.\nThis urge—and the small space I get to make the decision to fill it with someone—is what makes gratitude such a special “positive feeling.” This is how I translate it as a way to know God, and I’m feeling it every day. To know this Gratitude Register (just like how a CPU register is filled quickly and needs to assign the value to some process) requires some form of mental allocation.\nIf it happens and if I’m a full time atheist (I don’t wish that for anyone) I believe this interaction, of validating my day and unconsciously inviting “gratitude” as a result of just being human, shall rescue me from muddle and may guide me toward the light.\nThis is a piece of my honest and truthful analysis of my feelings toward gratitude.\n","title":"Gratitude Register","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/gratitude_register/"},{"content":" do things badly\nAs the years pass by, I find myself adapting to different reasons to keep living, and to share, I\u0026rsquo;m not as clear as I used to be about why I should be posting something publicly, but looking back over the years, I recall how writing started. How reasons changed.\nThe Seeds of Writing I\u0026rsquo;ve had amazing language teachers (Tahia and Jamal), who encouraged me to write and read since I was a little I\u0026rsquo;ve been under the wings of people who are naturally good at writing (this probably influenced me, I mean, I used to write poetry when I was a little) I felt the need to express my feelings through writing (I\u0026rsquo;ve been actively journaling since 8th grade) I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen in love with quotes and I became a collector at some point, they seemed to explain the world, so I started crafting my own through writing (High school/teenager period) I\u0026rsquo;ve wished people could write more about their experiences and not generic content When I needed someone to talk about Computer Science from their heart, experience, and not what they have studied Reem\u0026rsquo;s blog was my savior, and then later I loved the writings of Mohammed Yousif especially the self-reflection notes, and his feelings. I wanted to document my journey in life, I wished that the elderly people in my life had books/blogs that they had left behind for me, so I can get to know them more, even after they\u0026rsquo;re gone. I wanted to make sense of my doings, I would write the task I should be doing for myself to see if I understand the procedure that is supposed to happen, and if there are any subtle pitfalls in my understanding I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of. Yes, these are all different reasons, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how I\u0026rsquo;m going to organize them, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to overthink this.\nDemons but I got demons\u0026hellip;. that were holding me from writing.\nI get amazed by the number of clicks I write on the keyboard everyday writing something. and it is really fascinating how I barely share it publicly. I\u0026rsquo;m not in my best to recall the WHY behind why I\u0026rsquo;ve been skeptical about this, but below are what I can list now:\nBeing busy is the biggest factor for not sharing it publicly, not that I can\u0026rsquo;t press post/publish but that I have a cognitive overload from being busy, I get to experience and learn lesson on the fly which I assume its a bless. but it comes in huge numbers and sometimes hard to unpack what I\u0026rsquo;ve learn. so they time between me taking the lesson and preparing to share the lesson spans, if I assigned a name to this period, lets say C, there will even more lessons that will pop in that period which lead to me giving up completely on sharing.\nNot making sense of how this would help me. there was a time where I\u0026rsquo;ve had lost the meaning and I was blinded by something that I don\u0026rsquo;t know, the prevented me from seeing how this can help me in any way (practically speaking, yes I had reasons to write but not to share)? (later I found some reasons to share).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the writing tools: at that age being afraid is the default, I was telling myself if that x human is better than you at writing and knows how why would you still share? they got the experience, they got the talent, the got the time, they got the confidence. looking to back to how small I was to start such a thing makes sense.\nDo people call it a comfort zone?: I recall in 2023-2025 I stopped a number of my social media accounts repeatedly, until this very day, I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet posted one single status on my main WhatsApp account. And months can pass without sharing something publicly, now this has its own story, but it was one big reason that I\u0026rsquo;ve felt comfort in not being in public/ in not sharing, even if that is on social media.\nPrioritize what\u0026rsquo;s important: there is also a time when I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at the words that I\u0026rsquo;m writing, and that I should be sharing, but not to everyone, maybe I can do this to my closest people first, family, and friends. They deserve better, someone who is not being busy, but being responsive and collaborative. So throughout the last 2 years, I was investing more in my closest circle.\nDetails and setup: everyone has their own unique way of communicating, with mutual culture you get to say what you want smoothly (by smoothly I mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t face difficulties in deciding what to say and the recipient is not having trouble interpreting your words to what you actually meant) if we were to imagine how deviated I\u0026rsquo;m from that line, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not as close. maybe in reality I can relate and talk to people, but inside my head I overthink and over-engineer what I should say to the person in-front of me based on the data they are directly or indirectly steaming to me, will they relate to what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, are they comfortable talking about this, are they going to feel offended, am I talking fast, and not showing them the point, did I match their energy/slang, was the conversation interactive?, dozens of questions, now image you are talking to over thousand person, thats what I put in my mind and heart before sharing anything publicly. Now these details are hard to overcome.\nI\u0026rsquo;m wasting my time here: this is a real demon here, it tells me that the time I would spend in writing and then responding to people\u0026rsquo;s comments, inquiries, friendships, rituals out of curiosity about me from my posts, can be dedicated to doing something more useful, I would spend more time doing more important things maybe.\nmoving forward This blog website is an attempt; it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be the last one, but I have faith in it.#\n","title":"Why I’m Sharing Notes","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-do-this/"},{"content":" Early to rise early to bed, makes a man healthy but socially dead\nOne thing that i\u0026rsquo;m sure about is, that I don\u0026rsquo;t miss people easily, not that I don\u0026rsquo;t bare people, or I\u0026rsquo;m antisocial. but I keep myself busy to the point I forget about the people, I feel sorry for myself and for the people I know that I\u0026rsquo;m emotionally inactive when I need it.

I used to document at this time of the year, where I try as much as possible to reflect on the progress made this year, perhaps my learning process. Alhamdullah, I have learned a lot. And I have tales to tell, but hopefully, choosing the most significant one will find a wider audience and fit. I will talk in 3s three categories and 3 notes\nI will talk about What I learned about the world What I learned about the people What I learned about myself. I\u0026rsquo;m not very visionary and dreamy, so I think about life directly, but here are some lessons that I learned.\nWhat you learn models the way you think. We try as much as possible to interpret the complexity of the world and answer the why and how behind things; the way we think and use our minds is completely different based on what we have learned, and dictates how we will view the world. If that\u0026rsquo;s chemistry, you will look at life as a chemical reaction, a mathematician viewing it as a melody of logic, a writer as stories, and so on.\nThe reality has nothing to do with your hope. Life is very unpredictable; you can\u0026rsquo;t say good things happen for good people, or I have put too much into this project hence it will succeed, life has nothing to do with your hope.\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t pursue happiness directly. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall when was the last time I heard someone asking whether you are happy or not, and how to be happy. It looks like everyone is suddenly not talking about happiness, which is good in my opinion. Happiness is something you pursue indirectly.\nhere comes the people. Unexpected Time Sink You respawned in this world hoping that you would spend most of the time doing what you love, but then you realized that a great portion of your time is dedicated to people, some of them whom you might like, and others you will force yourself to adapt wasting time with.\ncheerful face and sweet words You can get what you want with a cheerful face and sweet words: People hold positions, some of them control the valves of opportunities. What I found is, besides having the potential to fit the need, if you have reached out, cold emailed, or any sort of communication, people will help you make things out.\nPeople have feelings, I guess. They feel, every single action you do influences the way they look at you. If you never show up for their invitations, if you were a bit off that day, your tune changed. I fooled myself for a long time, thinking that people would never notice the small things that I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\nAbout me. Struggle to see things from their perspective I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I can\u0026rsquo;t fully understand someone else\u0026rsquo;s situation unless I have been through something similar or if I am able to simulate/mimic/imagine the same circumstances. For instance,, if I live in the big city of Khartoum with a 9 - 5 job anda regular pace of life, I will never be able to generalize what people might suffer from and what challenges they face in different parts of Sudan. I just can\u0026rsquo;t.\nKeeping up, what is that? I\u0026rsquo;m the worst when it comes to keeping up with people and the news. In order to feel natural and get along with most of today\u0026rsquo;s youth and even adults, you need to have a middle ground to talk about, in most cases, football, politics, and news, which I don\u0026rsquo;t really bother myself to follow. So this is one of the things I learned that I simply suck at bringing topics to the middle ground.\nAvoiding Regret I love video editing/storytelling, tho I\u0026rsquo;m not editing as much as I used to, but it\u0026rsquo;s still one of the things that I loved doing naturally and unconditionally. I never admit to saying it verbally, but the reason I\u0026rsquo;m making videos is to capture a snapshot of time, just like git versions the code. The main incentive behind doing this action. is to avoid regret. I can\u0026rsquo;t live with this burden in my chest. There are dozens of videos that I discarded, many of which I\u0026rsquo;ve never started. Tens of drafts have never seen the light, and a bit over 50 were sent privately to the once i trust the most. so my advice to you is.\n","title":"21","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/21/"},{"content":"Things I was wrong about Recently, I came to the realization: I’m not giving people what they deserve. I don’t make it easy for them to stay close to me, not only strangers, but even the people who care about me the most. I build walls, my mood is forever changing around them, and constantly not around. And I know this is wrong. I noticed that at the beginning of relationships, I can match people’s energy effortlessly, but over time I gradually drift back into being distant and cold. It feels unfair, it\u0026rsquo;s hypocrisy. either I shouldn’t appear friendly in the first place, or I should remain consistent with the way I start. which is being friendly forever.\nCRM when thinking about these problems, I found out I was not up to the promises I tell myself, although I want to check on people I love from time to time, I don\u0026rsquo;t do that, I just can\u0026rsquo;t maintain it, I fail every time, I recently came to the term, Customer Relation management where business people keep track of their customers, and found a video that talks about applying this idea into tracking your social life.\nWhen I thought about these problems, I realized I wasn’t living up to the promises I made to myself. Even though I want to check on the people I love from time to time, I just don’t do it. I just can’t maintain it; I fail every time. Recently, I came across the term Customer Relationship Management, where businesses keep track of their customers, and I found a video talking about applying the same idea to tracking your social life. where you keep track of customers and call when you, its just a system that companies use to remember their customers. I did my own version on Notion , where I listed names of people I care about the most, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too late until I forgot about it. All my attempts seem to fail.\n","title":"I Keep Failing the People I Care About","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/i_keep_failing_the_people_i_care_about/"},{"content":" I’m not sure if it exactly look as I imagine it\nZeinab\nThe first time I encountered this idea was when talking to Zeinab Sami 016 FMSI, while I insisted that she must study how stochastic processes are involved in machine learning, she responded with something that falls into the idea: “Your perception of this major might be different from reality.”\nIndirectly, she helped me to adapt this as a new way of thinking when picking majors throughout my life, whenever we plan to study something new we might have initial assumptions about it, its almost the case, that our minds are not null when we study new materials, we do not only take assumptions with us, but also attach information we hear along the road with it. with extra imagination.\nMost of us have heard the term quantum mechanics, and you probably have imagined the nature of how these types of studies are, no matter how far your assumptions are from true, say you have been hesitating to enter an engineering degree due to your imagination of previous engineering classes or things that you have learned that helped you to generalize to the engineering concept. I’m not the best at making analogies, but I will tell the story of stochastic processes and my conversation with Zainab. She’s a Computer Science major who devoted more time and effort to mathematics while also maintaining good grades in CS related subjects. She shared me the work of a mathematician in stochastic processes after winning a Nobel prize on his word, or Fields Medal I really can’t recall it. we were arguing about how he managed to imagine these things, let alone architecting a framework to explain it, Although we tried to “wonder” but we come from completely different backgrounds, as I see stochastic processes from practical Machine Learning point of view, mainly thinking of “if I never set a random seed I might never reproduce my same results again, my weights will always initialize randomly, the gradient will always give different results/trough when minimizing the cost function”, Zainab is coming from a completely different background thinking about the mathematics how differential equations are implemented…etc.\nThis idea of things being as you imagine them, or as the image you are able to craft by generalizing from previous experiences, is something I often think about.\nHow to benefit from this lesson. Assuming you want to study a material in a new subject that you have never studied before, you will have generalization ability to predict how it\u0026rsquo;s going to be, but the reality might be different. and sure it is different, from the things that you can think of, it is always better to do the process to know how things are. quantum mechanics seems like you will be imagining where the cat is, what will happen if I observe it, but in reality, you will be doing differential equations, which will shape the framework of how you think about these problems. So this might let you think twice that THINGS ARE NOT AS YOU IMAGINE them, don’t let your assumptions fool you.\nInstead, it should be a part of your learning process, when you hit the realization of what actually this topic is talking about, for a very long time, I thought calculus is about calculation, after reading it I knew that it was talking about the rates of changing, and now I view as the art of dealing with tight spaces, and I will keep changing my assumption about it as I go, or maybe adding to the previous once. so having this flexibility will always help.\n","title":"What you want to major in might not be exactly what you imagine it to be","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/what_you_want_to_major_in_might_not_be_exactly_how_you_imagine_it/"},{"content":"Lately, I lost my ability to focus and maintain a flow state. I don’t sleep late, I eat relatively healthy food, and I’m not dopamine addicted. The problem comes down to practices that would align your efforts with what you want to achieve.\nToday, and after 15 days of nonsensical hard work (definitely I learned, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t comfortable learning), I get an hour with myself, having a lovely flow state, I will note and try to list all the things that I have done to get my focus back. 1. Sleeping early (70%) The percentage here indicates the importance of the action and how it contributes to the focus during the day, sleeping early isn’t new to me, I noticed that not doing this step, will degrade my performance (mentally \u0026amp; physically) particularly mentally, the physical condition can be refreshed after 1:00 PM or in the middle of the day, but the mentally is ever lasting throughout the day. But doing this step alone (i.e, validating how just sleeping early can affect your focus/performance) is not highly rewarding; it’s more of a prevention than a boost, which prevents you from having a bad day/focus rather than boosting you with flow state.\n1. Waking up early(90%) Now this is the most important part, sleeping early is not enough, you need its complement, which is waking up early, whether you slept at 9:00 PM or 12:00 AM\nWaking up early always makes it better to concentrate.\n","title":"Flow State and Sleep","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/flow_state_and_sleep/"},{"content":"I once read:\n“one of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know, someone in your class might find your presence inviting and warm even if you’ve exchanged a few words with them or maybe none at all, someone on the street loves your smile and it brightens their path for the next few blocks, someone who regularly comes to work is disappointed when you aren\u0026rsquo;t there, someone missed you today, someone noticed when you’re gone, someone loves you when you’re there, someone loves you when you’re nowhere to be found at all, you might think you have always disappeared when you’re no longer in the picture, but you never left the frame”\nAs far as I remember, this quote is the very reason I no longer question why people might feel my existence in their lives is adding value. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t project myself to if I were the “people”… do people help in my life indirectly, or without them knowing? Unlike my previous answers, which were showing independent personality and actions that didn’t need the “people” in their space. I found that sometimes people do change the way I think, talk, the frequency of doing something good, the latency of retrieving meaning from something, the hope and the discovery. Sometimes it’s crystal clear how I\u0026rsquo;m affected by their doings, other times it’s indirect; only their existence will bring every good part of me to life again.\nIt really sadness me that I was loved by many, more than I thought, I recently published a video, after a long time of me being distant, people went crazy sending to me and asking how I’m, and most of them notice that I was not around recently, I was fooling my mind that social life is not important, wether you are present or not, people will forget you, in short, it is hard to admit, but there are people out there who love us more that we know.\n","title":"The greatest tragedy in life","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_greatest_tragedy_in_life/"},{"content":"It was a rainy day when I realized that I was 19 years old, and I only had a few months left to turn 20. I’m no longer becoming a teenager, just like how John Green puts it, my 20s will go fast. My 30s will go faster than I can imagine, and suddenly I’m 40.\nYou can’t let your mind stop thinking about the future or let the things from the past stop controlling you. I have experienced life and responsibilities, but surely the 20s will be different, and I tried to answer one question: what am I afraid of? Why I’m afraid of being 20: and it turns out it is not only one question,but I was filled with lots of questions:\nWhat do I want to do for the rest of my life? What do I want to keep? What do I want to quit? Who will I stay with? Which people would I leave? Will I be able to practice my hobbies as the time I need to make videos and pursue my cinematography projects? What would happen to the way I think? Will my beliefs keep helping me? Will I remain a robust young dreamer or a dull mechanic worker in this fast world? Will I ever be able to never forget what I wanted to achieve? Will I be able to go through the mud as I entered the 20? Will the opportunities come? Will the things I love remain the same? Would I remain settled even after experiencing my 20s? Will I be able to interpret the complexity of the world and answer these questions, or just be the silent man who never ever thinks beyond his responsibilities? Or I will just ignore all the questions, and say in everything and every time there will be a crack, and it\u0026rsquo;s where the light gets in. And I should never create competitions and challenges that don’t exist yet. I’m sure Allah swt will guide me in every step, and just focus on what matters and eventually everything will come, and keep believing that all the things that I have lost will find their way to me. And it will come back to me. I’m turning 20 next week. Here are some lessons I think I learned in my teens, I may change my mind about some of them in the future.\nYour family must be no.1 priority in your life. You must have one thing that your life revolves around(Religion, category of people). People are not good at understanding themselves. Being Busy can prevent you from doing stupid things, and at the same time from good things, make sure to balance. Sleep early and wake up early. Don’t create competitions that doesn’t exist, be realistic. You can explore life in your teens and 20s and be a generalist, but set a limit for that and try to specialize and focus on the important parts. Routine is the small steps you take towards every big goal you set for yourself. A good level of understanding yourself, is knowing what you are not good at. If you’re a junior and you think you are smarter than an old outdated seniors, think twice; they have experience. Someone may find your presence warm and lovely without you knowing, so always be kind. If people do like you and you don’t know why, try to know why and keep practicing this thing for the rest of your life. Memories are the most warm feeling in the world, and the time you’re remembering them, will always be a happy time. I guess Happening is something that you pursue indirectly. Pray to Allah for giving you a clear mind, and practice exercise, eliminate distractions and you will have super flow state. Our beliefs are changing every time and we probably notice that late. If you ever felt happy for no reason try to ask yourself why? Write it down and read it when you’re down. Being optimistic about something and putting massive emotions into it doesn’t mean it will succeed. Reality is just independent of your thoughts Sad, or in pain? This will always come back at some point; you gotta use the time you have when you’re at your best. You may hurt people without knowing that you did, so you need to make sure you apologize frequently and ask people about how you behave. Chasing one thing will make the other things run away, like chasing a job but your health is in danger. You can be good at anything, including research and engineering, without a university, but the university is still important. We are not alike in the way we receive new information and knowledge; some know how to extract every possible information out of it, while others don’t. Mainstream titles like “entrepreneurship” can wait, and people who are seeking it since early ages of their career or uni want only the money, but they don’t have the needed skills and capacity to be the one. You may be good at using one of the technologies that uses scientific methods, but till you should always be humble to that outdated professor who spends his life solving equations and teaching math that you see as useless. You just didn’t realize the importance of it yet and the impact he is having. Avoid blaming your family members ","title":"20","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/20/"},{"content":"One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on Facebook , not consistently, and then I went through what I called “ Manulasis ”(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.\nThis happened because of the overwhelming number of times I discarded posts, notes, videos, or images I intended to share. Eventually, I gave up and abandoned the whole idea, and in doing so, I vanished from reality. This hesitation wasn’t new to me; I’ve been repeating this pattern since childhood. I would have sudden peaks of exposing my thoughts to the world, followed by long troughs of detachment and isolation. The amount of life that happens during those troughs makes it difficult to say everything when I finally try to reconnect with the world again.\nIf I turn a blind eye to the complexity, one of the strongest incentives behind sharing my notes is the fear of regret . I have been running from this feeling most of my life. The idea that all the messages, reflections, and thoughts I discarded will haunt me in the future terrifies me. This fear is closely tied to the feeling of standing on the Day of Judgment, knowing I had something that might help someone, but I never shared it. Recording what I’ve learned is a way to pass something forward to future generations.\n","title":"Why Im Sharing Notes - Regret","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-im-sharing-notes-regret/"},{"content":" There\u0026rsquo;s an anecdote about Richard Feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on Mr Feynman desk and makes a comment about these being a record of Feynman\u0026rsquo;s thinking and then Mr Feynman corrects the historian and says that: these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you\u0026rsquo;re thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that\u0026rsquo;s when Mr Feynman says: no they aren\u0026rsquo;t a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.\nIf I were to say the most important feature of making my life interpretable, it would be writing. I make sense of what is changing in my life through my writing, publicly, I don’t mention exciplicitly what is changing, but instead I just write. mostly about my beliefs, what I value, and the challenge I’m facing at the time. I do it multiple times throughout the year, and just by comparison, I can tell what changed. This self-reflection can help me distinguish between actual growth and commitments I made due to bad experiences, whether I adopted sudo-nihilism to cope with misfortunes, or if my pace in learning is slow and the road is very steep. All sorts of learnings in my journey are coming from my writings.\nAround 2018, I and Abd Alwahab Were arguing about some existential questions as teenagers while walking along the train track in the borders of our little small town district of Al-Daroshab , I came up with the realization that all the people who have died, are unable in anyway to share the lessons they have learned, not even as single lesson. through any channel. I remember that I never stopped talking about that idea with him that day. Years later, after deepening my understanding of our religion, Islam, the importance and encouragement of knowledge sharing, and the intolerance of not sharing knowledge.\nAlthough the priority is sharing the Islamic teachings and standing beside what is right. But I found that sharing small, minor details of our lives might be valuable. Scarcity of information: I was lucky that I was provided with an abundance of resources and access to people whom I can ask questions. I was raised having a computer, a brother to guide me through the installation of translators and IDEs on my machine, although he only just told me the names, but I was born lucky to some extent. I couldn’t even comprehend the idea of thinking about how my life would have been without having access to all the people and information. What I learned as a child significantly influenced the person I have become today. I never had the chance to appreciate this. Until a later period of my life, when I noticed a pattern of how the availability of information can lead to different lives.\nIn my primary-schooling period, I was smarter than most kids in “Computer” lessons and labs. And the teachers always ask me the following questions\n“Where did you learn this from?” or “Does your father come from an IT background?” so there must be a source of information, as they are assuming there is a light that must have guided you. something that sparked the first interest. That has led you to the person you are today. The same question is being repeated to students who are excelling in math (I suck at math), and looking back after I investigate them, they also had some sort of access to information (private tutor, aspirations, someone recommended a book for them), and so on.\nA model to understand information sharing. During my last year in high school, I started to view the world as a big network of knowledge/information sharing. I teach you computer science subject(what I use to do) and Abdalrahman (Math nerd who used to teach us mathematics) no matter how you are good in one subject you will always need help from different people, who are either in the same specialization that you’re looking for help with, or something else, This result of this processing of sharing information is to facilitate lives.\nWhat is wisdom does it have something to do with Making life much easier: I remember taking a consultation from Ali Azam one day about what university to pick, he told me that the university you’re going to pick will determine your next five years if not having a contribution to your whole life. He guided me through how its not just the name and reputation of the university but also the city where you live and ..etc a very concise definition of wisdom that I developed is: better decision making.\nAs I see many people are thinking about wisdom that same way as knowledge and whenever they heard the world a wise man they imagine someone who’s moving around with 200 IQ and quote to say everywhere. They ignore the fact that a wise man not only knowing but make actions and decisions based on his information.\nIf you zoom into your lifespan you would find there is this one component of decision making that significantly influenced your life today/the person who you are.\nThese decision are sometimes big ; whether to continue education or not, sometimes small; should I read today or play, the word decision is not about just being prompt to select between 2 or multiple choices, but it’s what you’re doing everyday you’re unconsciously calculate if you are going to sleep early or not whether you want to skip your leg day or study… etc\nEvery decision matter, not making a choice is also a choice\nThings I feel sorry about: One of the things I felt would make my life so much easier is knowing how to do math. Throughout my schooling period, I never encountered a math teacher who encouraged me to love math or helped me to do it; they did the exact opposite, except for the statistics and probability experience. And no wonder I love statistics more.\nWhen I entered university, I had to deal with all the previous experiences that had affected me. The access to top-tier students helped me make better decisions based on what they have experienced from success, failures, for instance, my senior Zainab helped me significantly understand math structure, and that I lack prerequisites for some courses.\nThis information sharing resulted in making my life easier. Sure, the math I had to deal with wasn’t easy, but in the hope of making this decision of going back to prerequisites, no matter how hard it is, it made my life later easier.\nI have seen people who never stop talking, but I couldn’t mine any useful information that would facilitate my life, while with little chatting with the most introverted person in the room, I can get advice that I never had the chance to know about.\nI shared my experiences in multiple aspects of life, whether it\u0026rsquo;s something big like joining a computer science school or not, or minor like recommending a software.\nWhile I was scared people would make a decision based on my experience, I kept emphasizing the idea that they should use the information they obtained from me as a data point, not final words, and it\u0026rsquo;s based on my experience, I try as much as I can to be unbiased and to tell what matches their needs. sometimes I receive messages from people saying that the decision they made has led a successful results, AKA make their lives so much easier. which I found very fascinating. most people who can help with information will be hesitant to share it, and even the failure when sharing it can be used as a decision making by someone else; this is basically how our lives work.\nThe reason why I’m writing these articles is the hope that there is someone who will make use of them in one way, taking a single idea that would inshallah help make their life easier.\n","title":"Why I'm Sharing Notes — Learned Too Late","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why_im_sharing_notes/"},{"content":"Progress: One of the good things I lack in my life is receiving feedback. Usually, everyone assumes that I’m an expert at everything, and they tend to define the way of our communication based on my social presence (oh, that’s Ahmed, everyone likes this dude. he is amazing… etc) while the reality is significantly different. I know several quality skills, like anyone, without having superpowers, I know how to speak, communicate, but I guarantee you I’m not the best!, and there is alot that you don\u0026rsquo;t know about me.\nThe problem is the iconography that the presenters who lead conversations/first time meets tend to define me with!

After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.\nOne day, I visited him at home and saw him packing up his bags, and some of his luggage was already packed. I was slightly irritated. he was so happy about his future, and I was happy for him too. Two years ago, I remember watching a video he shot that day, looking at myself, I could see how drowned I was in my thoughts, completely silent. Not many days passed before he booked his flight tickets.\nI went to the airport feeling completely numb . I even remember that my sister drove me, although I insisted on riding alone. I tried to make sure his journey went smoothly, helped him with the procedures, and it wasn’t long before I saw him hugging his family. That day, I didn’t grieve silently; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold myself. When he came to hug me one last time, I cried like a child. It was the most terrible feeling I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn’t stop myself from crying. I cried the entire way back home, at home, and again the next morning.\nFor the first time, my feelings rushed without control, without regulation, without avoidance; I got to see how vulnerable I was. With everything I had repressed before, the very distinct thought in my head was translated as: “I don’t know what to do with my life anymore.” It felt like I had lost myself. It felt like there was an important definition in my life that was suddenly gone. Even though the tears subside, writing this was never easy. I’ve tried to interpret what happened that day many times before, but most of the time I avoided thinking about it. Even now, while writing this, remembering it makes me cry like a child.\nThe days after he left were empty. I felt depressed and had no motivation to do anything. This eventually developed into severe social anxiety . I dragged myself into a cycle of illnesses and panic attacks that didn’t stop.\nFor almost four years, I hid my pain from him, how the days felt when he wasn’t around. I focused on how happy he seemed exploring a new world. I wanted to match his happy feelings, but two months ago, during a FaceTime call, the conversation suddenly shifted to the day he left. I was triggered and cried like a child again. I had never healed from the emotions I kept avoiding; they were always there, repressed.\nit was a goodbye I never recovered from, that particular departure triggered years of anxiety I was subconsciously avoiding by keeping myself busy, I miss you more than you can imagine, my friend. Not having you around was the hardest thing I ever had to go through.\n","title":"The Moment I Realized What He Meant to Me","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-moment-i-realized-what-he-meant-to-me/"},{"content":" your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.\nIt’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.\nAvoidant attachment is a pattern where you feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness and tend to pull away or shut down when relationships start to feel too vulnerable. Deep down, you may still want connection, but it feels safer to stay distant, guarded, or independent.\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of this term “Avoidant attachment,” and it is crazy how accurately it sums up and explains the recurrence of my patterns, Adding new friends systems , Elaborate Adding new friends system On avoidant attachment after watching videos about this topic, I felt it’s relevant to what I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing, and I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how mature psychology is, to the point of describing such a phenomenon. Below I will paste a comprehensive summary that can help understand the avoidant personality in a nutshell, and build on top of its light.\nYour avoidant isn\u0026rsquo;t fine, they\u0026rsquo;re just numb, to you it registers as indifference, what if they\u0026rsquo;re gone, what if they\u0026rsquo;re done, what if they\u0026rsquo;re over this, but internally on their part, it is an emotional shutdown. Avoidant don\u0026rsquo;t walk away calm, they walk away frozen, they don\u0026rsquo;t process in the moment, they don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened. They retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection. They are avoiding the emotional bill that just hasn\u0026rsquo;t hit them yet, because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them early, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them after a day or after a week, it hits them later on. When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone, and when they think that you have stopped expecting anything from them, that is the moment that it hits them. That\u0026rsquo;s when they start remembering the moment that they hurt you. And that\u0026rsquo;s when they finally feel what you felt in real time.\nThis piece is the first to encounter when searching for what this term means. I find it very accurate to the point I feel discomfort that there is someone out there is able to describe me in words, to have the words and explanation that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have, that I was searching for almost my entire life. I can see my own patterns here, by distilling this piece:\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened This explains the selective ignorance that I adapt\nthey retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection, this explains many of my disappearances because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame, all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you,this explains my writing state of numbness When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone; this explains why I avoided establishing direct relationship (closeness), and decided to use society buckets On the harm I caused others For a long time I believed I\u0026rsquo;m just not build for relationships, the moment someone brings emotions to our conversation I pull away, there is this poor Jonior whom I met recently and the moment he told me: “you\u0026rsquo;re cool, I like you, we could be friends”,As soon as he said that, I completely withdrew. and vanished from his life. Earlier this year I was talking to my friend Omer Monir. on how I’ve abundant the idea of romantic relationships in my life. Due to reasons I failed to interpret at the time, but the idea of I myself avoiding it, is a huge factor. What scares me the most about all sorts of relationships is the closeness and the commitment it brings, I can\u0026rsquo;t show up everyday, I\u0026rsquo;m terrified and not familiar with the intimacy that comes with establishing relationships, I run, I pull away and I shut down emotionally the moment these start to happen,\nthis explains why I freaked out when recently one of the uni colleagues told me I\u0026rsquo;m their best friend, I froze, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what did I respond with, he was so polite when he added the words “but I understand that you\u0026rsquo;re always busy and you don\u0026rsquo;t text too much, but I know that you\u0026rsquo;re a good man”, I was left speechless, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t say a word, I felt the guilt of how I\u0026rsquo;m not able to love them back the way they loved me. but at the end a person will only love you to the capacity in which they\u0026rsquo;re able to love themselves. I\u0026rsquo;ve failed many people before; they were victims of my avoidance, This dialogue helps me to imagine the kind of stress I put those people under.\nI\u0026rsquo;m being too much, the replies are getting colder, shorter, it\u0026rsquo;s like they don\u0026rsquo;t even care at all anymore, now I\u0026rsquo;m starting to freak out, because the only person I wanna talk to, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m interrupting them or I\u0026rsquo;m disturbing them, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m a burden, like I\u0026rsquo;m unwelcomed. Did I do something wrong, am I pushing them away, because they are not giving me the same energy that they did, I just want them to notice, I just want them to remind me that I matter to them.\nI once wrote how I\u0026rsquo;m really not good at putting myself in the other people shoes , and how I fooled myself into thinking people won’t be affected by my own patterns but in reality, I have hurt people, a lot of them, and I keep hurting more, by avoiding them, by showing up randomly and disappear frequently. It’s a strange grief to realize the amount of wounded people not out of cruelty I exposed, but out of an instinct, a second nature I caught before I ever had the words for it. The grief is even harder to bear when thinking that some people didn’t walk away from me; they walked away from the waiting. From my patterns. I only learned the cost after the silence became permanent.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful that the things I wrote in the past are finally becoming clear to me. A lot of friends helped to see this part of myself, how avoidant I am, including my best friend AbdAlwahab, and a bunch of victims. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this to result in a behaviour change soon, but at least for now, I can recognize my own patterns. At least for now, everything made sense.\n","title":"Learning the Truth About How I Love","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/a_grief_i_didnt_expect/"},{"content":"This piece of writing was part of an article I’m writing, about how I would help someone answering the question of “what do I want to do”, where I discuss how to pick a major and what helps you to define the way you contribute to this world. I found the draft of the article to be very lengthy, I may expected the reader to be aware of difference notions upfront, so I preferred this topic to be referenced here. As many of my drafts are pointing to it.\nIntro I started by highlighting how chasing long horizon questions can lead to unnecessary complexity that you might not have the tooling to unpack currently\nIt is not in your interest to waste time on investigating how the educational system started and why I need to get a degree in the first place, but rather to admit and sign up to the terms and conditions of this life. It is in your interest to know how to make the best use of your free will, if it was not, by your parents or conditions, to choose what you want to do in life. That might, but not necessarily result in your enrollment in a related field at the university, considering a topic as your side hustle or ultimately your profession, more on this later.\nConsent to the game rules is what I love to call accepting how the systems work, and agreeing to the terms and conditions that are dictated by our modern societies and cultures. What I will count as an example is the generalist/polymath who would argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to pick a major, or they want to consume more than one major; this can result in abandoning the educational system or not taking it seriously. I will consume all arts and sciences until the line drawing these distinctions diminish, they say. Although this is a bold claim that no one dares to hold, people underestimate the amount of discipline they need to maintain in order to achieve what their perception wove.\nI always think of the American Constitution promoting the amendments about the division of labor that, in order for the nation/community to grow and help optimize the metrics for its greater good, economics, innovation, fast food, and the good things we have in our modern societies. People should be specialists.\nthis is more of a reality check that defines the way the world functions, if happens and you are one of those people buying the idea of being a generalist, I\u0026rsquo;m not telling you to drop the idea, but most importantly telling you you\u0026rsquo;re swimming against the odds by being a generalist, and that you need to make sure your good plan of becoming a generalist helps you and ultimately us in providing something meaningful to the world and it is not a recursion. not just illusions of being special. Although someone might argue that the future belongs to those who combine different skills, for now, this is an example of resistance in consenting to the game rules.\nConsenting to the game requires being able to make sense of why the world is the way it is, and to be ready to take off all the chains holding you back from starting to contribute to the world, wether this is despair of how much evil exists in the world, or confusion of how disorder the systems are, skepticism because if any of this real, or if my doings matter, these questions regarding the game of life need to be answered to finally consent with a rested heart after all the searching to the game rules.\nbut as you can see, most of these questions are philosophical, they are about meaning, existence, identity, things that you will naturally experience the moment you you\u0026rsquo;re conscious, others might require you to explore politics and economics, what you need to do is simple, to just believe in the idea of making tomorrow a better day, to Reduce your suffering. because this will help you in the pursuit of existential clarity, and will yield you will stamina to purse answers in different directions, this worth a standalone article but the gist of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying is, if you want to find answers to the questions you are having, you need to be good with whatever will serve you in making tomorrow a better day, the same way you are good with the language, out of its importance in describing the universe, you need to be good and welcome with the things that will minimize the complexity of your situations, having an initial faith you will be facing the game rules (The nonsense you don\u0026rsquo;t understand) and use it as instrument for better you. if this might still abstract I might indeed to write a standalone point.\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t be thriving and winning unless you stand and consent to the game rules. Staying the same and doing nothing will only make it worst, so we pick what is less painful; to get up and find answers, to contribute to humanity with what we will find.\nFinding Answers Some of these questions you need to answer in order to consent willingly to the game rules can take years, and this is definitely not the best case scenario, especially in your case, where you want more answers to forecast accurately. However, the best case scenario is to have the ability to be selectively ignorant,\nSelectively Ignorant If you can classify these kinda of questions that will drag you into an infinite loop, it is better to carry on your work by ignoring these questions and having their burden in the background, in the hope that they will be answered one day. This will help minimize the complexity of your decision-making. Selective ignorance is applied in different parts of my life; maybe I will write more about it in the future.\nThat Will do My second advice is not to overthink whether the answers you\u0026rsquo;ve got are optimal, or if it\u0026rsquo;s an answer that made you feel good. If it fits and helps you in the process of getting closer to start consenting to the game rules, then use them as placeholders. The unveiled insights and joy of consenting to the game are more rewarding than the value of time wasted searching for the optimal. Do not care about the sources, it can come from something minor as a random quoted message you read on some random street walls written by a heartbroken lover, that you will consider as the last piece of the puzzle, TEDx talk, discussion with a friend. university course, whether your sources were science, religion.

I hesitated to make new friendships , I hesitated to share my writings publicly .\nThe reason is I was, and to this very day concerned with the questions that deviated me from being socially active. One of these questions is:\nWhat happens to a young person’s expectations about life when most of what they see one the internet are idealized stories, overly wise, unrealistic narratives? What happens to my community if this is the kind of discussion being shared publicly, which is mostly unproductive, pointless, trivial, and hollow? Can I change this?\nI\u0026rsquo;m still young, actively consuming data from the world, learning, and constantly changing. Sharing my opinions is not making the world a better place, I\u0026rsquo;m sure whatever I write be deprecated by my constantly evolving beliefs . so why bother writing? the world has enough of people talking, saying they want to make it a better place. The world is full of people who are more \u0026ldquo;qualified\u0026rdquo; to talk than myself although no one listens to them. Writing random quotes on social media that can mean different things to different people, or sharing a meme that can help someone heal, was enough for me.\nThis hides the part of my life I don\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable revealing in lengthy stories and lessons. The problem is that the majority of people end up using social media as a self help book. They look up to people\u0026rsquo;s achievements to get inspired, craving stories that match their personal circumstances and challenges. People are subconsciously building a map about the world using what is shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X…\nAn example: someone doubting their journey in learning finance، feeling lost in the equations, thinking they’re \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo; because everyone else seems to master the math effortlessly and even automate process in software tools. What people don’t say is that doubt is normal, and many of these equations aren’t intuitive at all, hardly understood at any given time. and It’s okay to feel confused Another example . someone just learning software engineering opens LinkedIn and feels left behind because people post about how they can solve noble problems using data science and machine learning software 2.0 they say. They may feel others are more impactful, and build the statement \u0026ldquo;all people working in data science are impactful\u0026rdquo; while in reality, most of these are demo projects, graduation projects, or research ideas far from implementation. I experienced the same when I first accessed the internet, consuming materials that seemed ideal, perfect, true, valid ,but are far from reality.\nNot explicitly mentioning our imperfections, hiding them, does not help. Packaging them in memes, stories, or art might provide temporary comfort and company for someone receiving, but it might not be good in the long run. I see this as one of the factors contributing to people\u0026rsquo;s despair these days. We tend to package our social appearance with what we find worth showing. Of course, you won\u0026rsquo;t go out there showing people all the insecurities you have. Telling them how you overcome social anxiety, they believe its a myth, or how awkward your hobbies are, you will be judged harshly. A few people do this. But in searching for perfection, we forget the most natural attributes of being human: being present , being emotional, being wrong.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m about to talk publicly or post on social media, I overthink if my writing matches all backgrounds and ages of my audience, if people would think I\u0026rsquo;m insecure about something, and if my writing is solid. That\u0026rsquo;s why I mostly write short quotes, not sharing experiences, lessons, or opinions, and ultimately suppressing my emotions.\nLife isn’t a set of solutions Life isn\u0026rsquo;t made up of a set of solutions for you to find.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built on extreme behaviors you learn to balance.\nAs a result of not engaging fully socially I have mastered controlling and potentially suppressing my emotions; which led to numbness . eventually I lost the meaning and pleasure of sharing my experience. the silence of surviving a day that no one knew about was hard, but the comfort zone I build covered this. Other factors include I\u0026rsquo;m very good at keeping myself busy and having master\u0026rsquo;s degree in wearing custom masks. By letting myself speak more honestly, I’m not only helping myself grow; I’m giving something back to the people who read me. If I share things as they are not polished, not idealized I might open a small space for someone else to breathe, to doubt safely, to feel normal again. And maybe this is how I contribute: not by being perfect, but by being real when most people aren’t.\nNow, I need to learn the opposite: I need to engage, to care. I need to feel and to love. To enhance the quality of my life, I must show my true colors without abandoning myself.\nI must stop wearing masks and let the changes that happen to me show up in my behavior with people. This way I can know who truly loves me and whose concerns include my problems.\nPerfect time does not exist if you wait, until everything feels finished, you gonna miss the people who would have loved you exactly as you are.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve waited for a long time to get it right, to feel certain that I finally figured it all out. That I will have a good map of reality which can define ideal human interactions for me. But this never happened, and I might waste my life waiting. And planning.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give this a shot I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to read books, rush the process of writing and publicly sharing, spend hours consulting friends, and form smaller communities to test my ideas. Did they work? Not entirely, but they provided lessons and information. I have no clue if this is just one of those random 3:00 AM bursts of motivation or if I’m finally tired of my own patterns, but one thing is sure: life rewards actions more than intelligence. I have a preliminary outline of what I want to do, and I should not overthink and drown myself in inaction. I will fail, it\u0026rsquo;s okay. I\u0026rsquo;m freaking out while writing this, but the signs point me to try. I will share more because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. Sharing my uncertainty can help someone; sharing my doubts when learning something can make someone\u0026rsquo;s day better. Sharing my insecurities can bring me people who help me overcome them.\nIn the end Having these pieces of notions connected and understood took me a long time. Yesterday, I was vulnerable, unaware of what I write here. My writing is not perfect; I could have used wiser words. Blind spots, potential mistakes, and pitfalls await me, but I welcome them, and I welcome whoever helps me in my journey.\nFor what is a man what has he got If not himself then he has not To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way.\n","title":"Learning to Feel Again","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/learning_to_feel_again/"},{"content":"I had a friend I met online who struggled with social anxiety. He used to tell me how he panicked at the idea of going to the university. I knew he wasn’t lying, but part of me couldn’t truly believe it, that a psychological disorder could control someone that much. I was telling him: you just needed to stop overthinking that people will hurt you, remind yourself there’s no reason to be afraid, and call it a day. Yes, I was ignorant. I tried to convince him to change something he couldn’t change, to “overcome it,” as if these were only voices in his head.\nIn 2022, I joined the University of Khartoum. I enjoyed the first few weeks before I flew out of the country and returned only for the first semester exam. like any freshman, I spent that first year in exploration, even though I was mostly abroad and only came back for exams and a few short periods.I was just given access to all sorts of materials. I just got good at googling things, MIT lectures, practical sessions, philosophy, logic, debates, activities. I wasn’t extreme/insane compared to people who signed up for every program and consumed whatever their eyes landed on, but I was selectively adding to my curiosity bucket, which happened to be very large. At that time, I was a firm believer in “having the skills” rather than just scanning books, which of course didn’t make me a healthy intellectual out of me, not the kind with good habits and healthy shape. No, it did quite the opposite. It put my health at risk.\nI had early signs that something bad was about to happen. I even mentioned this to my friend Kenyata , telling him how much I lack entertainment and simple enjoyment in my life. I was in Morocco at the time, I told him that when I return back to Sudan, I wanted to explore life a bit, pause from the grind, and see what people did outside academics and work. I told him I planned to try different restaurants. And honestly the reason I wanted to have a pause was that, my brother had been asking about my social life. He somehow convinced me it was important for my health to go outside, socialize and meet some friends. I took his advice seriously because he’s an introvert like me, and I hoped that piece of wisdom came from his own experience. But when I came back, I overloaded myself with even more tasks. I consumed even more material, aggressively. The social promise I made to my brother vanished, and I completely forgot the need to entertain myself.\nI remember that day clearly, the night before was long I spend the whole night awake and went into the exam without any rest, it was a calculus exam so you can imagine the amount of preparation I needed to put. after the exam, I went to the Computer Science department building at the faculty (the one basically colonized by IT students) for a reason I can’t even remember. I was somewhere in the middle of the first staircase. and without any premises I felt I was dying.\nI experienced a tunnel vision , I felt I was isolated from the world, My heart started beating so fast for no reason, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel normal at all. I was shocked to the point I could barely breath, I was lucky that the stairs had a handrail I can hold onto, I slowly made my way to the building\u0026rsquo;s entrance, where some seniors noticed there is something wrong with me, I\u0026rsquo;ve asked them to bring me water and mango juice (Maza) for some reason, maybe I thought it was a sugar problem. I was carried to what I think was the network admins office or something similar where I rested but my heart couldn\u0026rsquo;t slow down. Thankfully a girl from my batch called Esraa saw me and stood stayed with me stood by since,\nI was taken to the hospital, where they put all those sensors to my chest and ran different scans and tests. After about half an hour of that relentless, heavy heartbeat, my heart finally slowed down. I expected nothing less than a stroke or some kind of heart condition. I even had this dramatic thoughts that I might die from heartbreak for reasons I had woven in my head. I thought, This must be it.\nSurprisingly, all the scans were clean. I remember the doctor telling me my heart was “like a horse’s heart,” and that I didn’t have any heart disease. Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the horse\u0026rsquo;s heart analogy I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less, but It was a relief, although I was too mentally overwhelmed to process anything. I never followed up with the doctors to understand exactly what happened. My family arrived and took me home. My sister Zeinab, who is a doctor, told me it was a panic attack and explained what that meant. I watched some videos about it including this TEDx video I remember clearly, and I immediately related to it. I also joined online support groups and found comfort in hearing other people’s stories.\nI was healing from this accident by listening to the stories of people who experienced the same thing. Knowing that others had gone through similar circumstances that I wasn’t alone was reasonable to me to relief. But I never looked into why I was triggered in the first other than knowing “stress can lead you here, and it will reoccur when you trigger it again.”\nI eventually noticed a pattern: I felt discomfort whenever I was at the university. I remember this day very distinctly where I wanted any excuse not to go there. And luckily for me, the car I used to drive had almost no gas, and I wasn’t planning to stand in a long fuel queue. For but for some reason, though, I decided to go using public transportation, first a city train, then a bus. While crossing the bridge, Kobry Alhadeed, I started getting anxious. I felt afraid. And the closer I got to the university, the more scared I became. I can’t remember the lectures from that day, but it was the day I confirmed the pattern.\nWhat shocked me was what happened after the lectures. A friend told me he wanted to pick something up from the Computer Science department building and asked me to walk with him before we return back home.I found myself standing in front of the entrance, and my stress levels were extreme. I couldn’t enter the building. That’s when I knew: this was the thing I feared. I was afraid that if I entered that building again, something would happen to me.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the building is officially the “CS Department,” but it’s mostly used for IT lectures. Since I’m a computer science student, I was never required to be there, I had no courses inside that building. But I used to go there anyway because many of our friends had lectures there and were always hanging out. What I didn’t realize is that I had been avoiding it the entire time without noticing. I didn’t enter that building again until the course finished.\nWriting this now triggered me a bit. It seems that building really freak me out the most. While I was fighting these internal battles with panic attacks, the symptoms started to manifest as IBS. I thought it was genetic, most of my family has it, but my sister told me mine was caused by stress, and because you were very stressed recently, the IBS decided to accompany you. And she was right, the conversations I had with Kenyata about pausing the grind, was because a very subtle, inner voice was whispering to me, you need to take rest, but because I was exploring and the dopamine was always high, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t notice that I was under stress, stress that I love doing, stress out of things I loved, I later learned that even the things you love can make you sick, but it was too late. I noticed I only experienced the symptoms when I was stressed, not when I ate garbage food.\nDuring that period, a sudden shift hit my social life, it changed suddenly. I couldn’t hold conversations longer than a minute. I avoided people, especially the ones I knew well. I felt that if I talked too much, I would die. And I mean that literally, that’s how it felt. Talking to people I knew became the scariest thing ever. Almost everyone in my batch noticed. “Ahmed has changed.” Some even sat with me and asked what was going on. I’m not sure what I told them, but I’m sure I said something like, “everything is fine”, because I had no words to describe what I was going through.\nAnd suddenly, I had social anxiety. Me? Ahmed? the guy who initiated our batch group chat, who was nominated to be the batch representative, who used to be public and comfortable speaking. I wasn’t afraid of people. And now I had social anxiety? It was hard to believe. It was a dramatic shift. My online friend the one I used to make fun of when he told me he had social anxiety, I was slowly beginning to understand him, and to understand how ignorant I had been. I never imagined a day would come when my thoughts would no longer control my body.\nI was skeptical. I made several assumptions to explain what I was experiencing. The first was returning to the idea that I actually had a heart disease, because all the discomfort was happening in my chest and around my heart. The second was that I might be bewitched or cursed somehow. And the third was that it was a punishment from God, because I had once thought my friend was exaggerating his condition, and making things up. Between those assumptions, I was lost. I genuinely didn’t know what was happening to me.\nA new fear was unlocked during that time. where I went to picnic and I met some friends some of them for the first time, it is common in Sudan, we greeted each other with hugs, before handshakes. I remember seeing the first group of friends, and before we even hugged, my body was signaling that I should run, that I shouldn’t let anyone touch me. I\u0026rsquo;m someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like physical interactions, but not to the point of being terrified of it. I didn’t want this. I forced myself to hug them “normally”, and of course I didn’t die, but my stress levels was even higher than when I stood in front of the CS department building. At that moment, I believed for sure that I was bewitched. There was no way, that someone can get stressed and feel like they might die from hugging a friend, someone I should have been happy to see.\nAfter about two hours, another group of friends arrived, and when it came time for the hugging thing again, I partially fainted and fell to the ground. My friend Mustafa sensed my heartbeat; it was beating to the max. I don’t remember the exact dialogue, but they gave me something to drink and eat. And then I was fine again. They were confused because my explanations weren\u0026rsquo;t clear; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear to me either.\nI don’t remember a lot from that period because too many things were happening at once. But I do remember that after that picnic, I stopped meeting people entirely. I skipped university for several days. And it wasn’t long after that when the war started. To this day, I still can’t fully understand why all of this happened. But at least I evaluated my assumptions: I have came to the realization I wasn’t bewitched. After about eight months, I went back to working out and running, and being able to do those things easily, without any heart issues, boosted my confidence that I didn’t have a heart disease.\nI was gradually disappearing from people\u0026rsquo;s life, I had no motivation to talk to people, I have more things that are telling me not to connect with people, I mean if just hugs are doing this to do. lol, Looking back, I see many people who have no explanation for why I disappeared from their lives, why my behavior changed so drastically. Things weren’t good even before the war they were getting worse, but at least they eventually led me to understand that stress was the cause, even when I couldn’t feel the stress itself. One of the strange, almost funny stories from that time: several weeks after the incident, the right side of my face became completely paralyzed. I couldn’t move it at all. I went to the hospital, they diagnosed me with Bell’s palsy , a condition where the facial nerve on one side of the face suddenly stops working. And of course I was bewitched, of all the diseases that I know, I was given a weird paralysis in the face, someone must have wanted to torture me. After reading more about it, I learned that stress can also cause it. I rested my heart by saying, Stress is the cause.\nI remember I landed an internship but only went onsite for a total of three days. I remember barely speaking to my best friends during that entire period. I don’t remember much about how things were at home either, but I’m sure I kept myself constantly busy. Those days affected almost every part of my life. I tend to have a weaker memory for the bad times, but what I’ve written here are the extremes, the moments I simply couldn’t forget. The belief that I always had control over my mind and my body, that I can act as a commander was a heaven that I only realized when I lost control, when my mind and body turned against me. I was afraid that people would see me as vulnerable, I was afraid that with all this stress adding more and more complexity to my life, that I would be dependent on someone, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be burden. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to know that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ok.\n","title":"Days That I Don’t Understand","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/days_that_i_didnt_understand/"},{"content":"The velocity at which I\u0026rsquo;m updating my beliefs about the world has never been known to be slow; saying \u0026ldquo;Oops\u0026rdquo; and updating my beliefs implies updating my behavior if needed.

I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.\nSean, Good Will Hunting (Park Bench Scene)\nAlthough my previous blog post was expected to be an explanation of what I assumed to be something I adopted a long time ago and never updated before:\nbut I have never revised the list since a while\nAdding new friends system I never expected the system to be perfect, or that I was doing what is ultimately right. The reason why I felt I should be listing this legacy system of adding new friends by writing the blog post , is because I felt it was the time to rethink it. I wasn’t explicit about this, (meaning it took me time to realize that I really need to rethink it.), but I felt this shouldn’t continue. The case analysis is not as good as it used to be in helping classifying people, many cases violated the rules, but the system still pulls me back to use its methods. [!IMPORTANT] I will be using the terms system and legacy system interchangeably. The term legacy system refers to an outdated but still functional computer system, software, or hardware that continues to be used because it performs its original, essential tasks, even as newer technologies emerge.\n[!NOTE] I deliberately selected the term value when saying assigning the name “Friend”, because it is not just a word, I consider it a value. Calling you a friend adds the values that require me to “allow myself to fall, to invest my emotions.”\nby this elboration I hope to clear the misconceptions that might accure from my previous writing, it build on top of the previous blog post Adding new friends system , you might want to take a look if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. this conversation will particularly discuss the cases where the system is not good enough, why I was still using it?, how it is so bad to the people who should be friends.\nWhy so many rules? Life is meant to be simple. There are many levels to look into why I don’t actually find it hard to rank people.one is Checklist based thinking happens everywhere, by everyone. First impressions are a sort of ranking system, and most people don’t take any effort in check listing their candidates, because it happens in the background of their minds, embedded just like first impressions.\nThe same happens to me, except that I might be using more rigorous tests. So I’m not really adding logic to the equation of life, it’s already there.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m not really walking around ranking people according to my checklist of what I favor, it is my mind that blocks me from transcending a relationship beyond what it is, unless it satisfies what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. this can act as a reason for why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so urgent about changing it, because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really suffering from it, it is something that happens almost naturally.\nAll the cool friends I could’ve made When establishing relationships, it is almost always the case that I don\u0026rsquo;t assign the value friend to them easily, lets call these people \u0026ldquo;candidates\u0026rdquo;, The best scenario is to have candidates who don’t care whether I gave this title to them or not; they don’t even ask about it. They see that I’m doing my best to match their energy.\nbut you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should\nAdding new friends system We’re supposed to enjoy the relationship without hindrance. I would do a great job at this, they would know I’m someone who never minds spending quality time with them, that I respect them, and am always happy to see them. Until they start to investigate their role within me too early.\nAnd if this happens, they won’t like it. They’ll translate me not adding them to the “friends” list as being heartless, as though they’re the ones taking part in the relationship, not me.\nI’d love if the universe worked according to my rules: why care about titles when I’m already there for you? But in the end, it’s not their fault. I shouldn’t have adopted this system in the first place, let alone explaining its creepiness to people or expecting them to understand it.\nHandling the misconceptions about “I will magically force myself to never invest emotions in the relationship” will take part shortly in this post, but for now, remember that the legacy system seemed to work for what I wanted it to do.\nhowever it does a greater job preventing “bad friends“. It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends) and this is where it helps me the most.\nAdding new friends system As long as it helps me make friends, and provides the definitions and rules of human interaction to me, I have no problem using it. But the real question is: why am I still using this legacy system?\nElaborating on the effects but there are downsides you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself.\nAdding new friends system Yes, I control the amount of love I stream toward someone/candidate, even if they were perfect candidates. I won’t send them any signals that strengthen our bond. I’ll avoid them. I’ll do what it takes to not invest emotion, and I’m good at it.\nI only stream what I think is sufficient to match their energy. The real downside is when this loop continues. They feel the walls I’m building hindering the relationship, and at that particular point I get disturbed.\nAt this stage, the best scenario is to respect the walls and plan to tear them down over time (though sometimes they’re never meant to be broken).\n1. Leakage in the system. In theory, I get to decide that I will not invest emotions, by controlling the amount of lets say love I stream for someone (love implies trust), just as computational theories ignore practical constraints, but in practice, emotions are not precisely controlled; they leak easily\n2. a double-edged sword. it is very common that I lose potential good friends in the process, and that hurts, seeing cool people leave. they realize how hard it is to deal with me, and then stop trying.\nThis cycle of people showing genuine interest in me, then suddenly losing it, is hard. It happened when I wasn’t aware that I had so many walls, that people aren’t good at climbing them. I was ignorant, selfish, not giving guidance on how to approach me.\nThinking it’s your thing to figure me out, who did I think I was? King Richard the Fifth? May I never trust my judgment again.\n3. But I\u0026rsquo;m hurt 2. What once felt unbearable to remember now feels necessary to recall. This one almost slipped out of memory, but when I lost those potential cool “friends,” I wasn’t happy about it. I remember now that I didn’t like it at all.\nI felt destined to live alone, not knowing I was drowning by my own design. I was too young to realize this. And instead of revising the list of rules I set to add new friends, to make them less rigorous, I fed it even more.\nWhy the legacy system is still in production Besides the system doing its job, there were boosters that helped keep it running.\nLet go before they let go:\nThe cycle of people entering and leaving my life left a scar. I started letting go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself caused these bad experiences to accumulate. It taught me that people leave, so I began preemptively leaving first.\n“People will stop trying to know you, you piece of shit. You’re setting the walls so high they won’t even try to climb them.” telling myself. And I had no idea that it was me causing this. That’s how two insecurities start boosting each other.\nThe legacy system is not helping me establishing new friendships (pending status cases). People are letting go of me because of this embedded legacy system. I let go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself helps me in the process of letting go of the people The legacy system says \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re anxious that they might leave you. I can help you to get rid of them preemptively.\u0026rdquo; The system rewards me by \u0026ldquo;either way, they might have been bad friends or they didn\u0026rsquo;t pass the tests\u0026rdquo;. man screw the tests.\nin short this monster was feeding itself. and apparently me.\nIrresistible features:\nMy sister once made an observation during a family discussion about our dark past selves. She noticed that growing up (me), I had access to the bad world, with tons of potential bad friends I could’ve made, but I chose not to.\nThe system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, actual true negatives, the ones that really would’ve hurt me. The problem is, it also keeps making false positives: rejecting people who were good, who could’ve stayed. It convinces me that losing them was just self protection,Though it’s hard to take the burden of \u0026ldquo;controlling the stream of love towards someone\u0026rdquo;, it’s also hard to be stabbed in the back. The system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, There was no other way, it was either being armed with it or being naïve and cut by friends.\nI’m good at keeping myself busy:\nThe legacy system not only controls how much love I give to people, it controls how many people I give it to.\nThose I call friends rarely exceed five or ten. I keep myself busy, which limits how many interactions I can manage. I’ve learned I don’t need to make a friend in every new country or city I live in, not doing so doesn’t kill me.\nI manage the few friends I have very well. They give me more than enough. I don’t plan to have many friends, it’s not aligned with my social energy or resources. The legacy system is good at controlling that number. It’s a win-win.\nAnswers not found elsewhere:\nSometimes I think about dismantling the system and moving on, but questions arise:\nHow do I prevent wounds if I step outside my walls?\nHow do I define friendship as something prestigious and not instantly given?\nThe first fence in the system is crucial, it helps control the number of people in my life. I can’t be friends with everyone I meet; I’d end up with too many.\nQuestions the legacy system fails to answer Some questions the system simply can’t answer well:\nWhat should I do if they figure it out?\nPeople go through painful ups and downs during the “pending” phase. They lose meaning in establishing a relationship once they realize they’re not assigned a value yet.\nI wasn’t trained to trust people this fast, but it’s not right to keep them hanging. The system doesn’t guide me here: should I explain it? Should I force myself to love them or assign the value they deserve?\nWhat should I do with pending requests?\nSome people are never meant to enter, I prefer keeping walls between us. The system doesn’t provide guidance.\nI remember a friend, culturally a friend, but I never really invested in him. He was great, but I didn’t want to allow myself to fall into that bond. Poor him, what did he have to do with my hormones? Again, the system didn’t help.\n404 Not Found:\nSometimes I fail to migrate relationships outside the scope of the greater good , that shared purpose that once connected us.\nI meet cool people in cool places; we like each other. But once the shared context is gone, I can’t find a new reason to stay connected.\nOutside the greater good:\nSome people are great under the scope of a project or purpose, but outside it, I can’t find what links us. Their attempts get pended.\nUndefined “something”:\nothertimes its more specific cases, For example, someone once part of my team, ideally female, wanted to get to know me outside of that shared goal. “Female friend”? I have no definition for that. How should I act? I don’t know, but I’ll definitely run away from anything undefined, lol.\nIf this isn’t your case, good for you. Some people don’t suffer from basic questions like deciding whether to make someone a friend or not. But I do, not enough to urgently change, but enough to notice it.\nI can still approach people, create one sided friendships, get what I need, make them smile, make them do what I want gently, wish them well, and support their wins.\nMost importantly, I can keep myself busy enough to avoid looking too closely at my malfunctioning legacy system.\ntoday! I’ve unlocked a hidden insecurity that’s been operating subconsciously, one I partly knew existed but never realized how much it was feeding other insecurities.\nThis moment of self-awareness feels like progress. I just need to unlearn it now. It might take years, but I’ve begun.\n","title":"Elaborate: Adding New Friends System","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"I get asked:\nHow do you deal with ordinary people? The ones that don\u0026rsquo;t bother you? and when does it start that they enter your life?\nThis question has got me thinking. I recalled that checklist (set of rules) I have for making new friends, but I have never revised the list for a while. I have seen cases where people just hack the system, and suddenly they are knocking on the door of my heart before even check-listing half of it.\nThe set of rules I have adapted is simple enough to help me make new friends; however, it does a greater job preventing “bad friends.” It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends), and this is where it helps me the most. More about it later; first, let’s get to see where this starts.\nIn elementary school, I made the observation that most people around me complain about how they were betrayed, stabbed in the back, or any sort of resentment that happened to them, caused by relationships, particularly friendships. To make sense of why they suffer, my observation was: “All these people you were hurt by, you had positive feelings about them; you loved them.\u0026quot; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be in such a position, so I learned through preaching to myself.\nthe equation was obvious to me: \u0026ldquo;the more emotions I invest in someone, the deeper the wound is,\u0026rdquo; and you start investing emotions in people the moment you assign them the name \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; in your head. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall this equation resulting in me being afraid of making friendships, but what I did was to learn from them. What I learned is that many cases were wounded because they were too early in assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the people they met.\nAs social creatures, we tend to make friendships in the new places or paths we take (new school, new university, new habit…) or sometimes when we feel lonely, or even worse, when we are too optimistic. However, these reasons do not respect the slow pace needed for making friendships; they are in a rush. For example, a fresher might feel either very overwhelmed by the number of questions they got, so they try to establish friendships (either to feel no guilt if people also turn out not to have answers, or to have answers), or very energized by the amount of sudden freedom they were never granted before, and they want to make friends to do all sorts of crazy things they want to do. So whether your reasons were noble (work on study groups, research, projects, politics) or less impactful (host parties, go to the park), they are all tagged with urgency. Of course, you can\u0026rsquo;t wait two years to make a friend.\nFor these very reasons, \u0026ldquo;bad friends\u0026rdquo; happen, that we needed to call someone a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; we had tons of emotions that couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold their horses and needed someone to run for.\nHow I planned to overcome this? Simply don\u0026rsquo;t call people your \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; I haven’t used that term for as long as I can remember. My very first friend, I was telling myself about \u0026ldquo;Wow, this guy has done so much for me. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to call him a friend, then I\u0026rsquo;m selfish and heartless\u0026rdquo;. What people don\u0026rsquo;t understand is that I still had a quality time with that guy without calling him a friend. I was enjoying my life with them, and I was making memories.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve applied what happened with the first person I ever admitted by heart as a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the friends I met down the road, is to never call them friends until time passes and they prove they are trustworthy.\nIf you keep saying everyone is your friend, you will end up wounded alot.\nBut there are downsides, you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you are going to be in defense mode all the time (or it is not that bad; maybe you will get used to it), but you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should. But don\u0026rsquo;t call them friends, not yet, because the moment you start assigning them the value \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; you allow yourself to invest more emotions (trust, love, loyalty…). If you have an argument saying friendship should not be that hard, and at the start I don\u0026rsquo;t really allow myself to fall completely, then this is good for you, but for me, no. Assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to people means a lot more, so I don\u0026rsquo;t give it away that easily. Luckily, society gave us names as placeholders for people that even can help define the interactions and limits of relationships to have with people: there are Coworkers, Neighbors, Classmates, Colleagues, Managers, Team members, Collaborators, Customers, Clients, Students, Teachers, and even Mutuals (your friend\u0026rsquo;s friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be your friend). Why don\u0026rsquo;t people use these? They are good, they protect you, they help you.\nGoing back to our discussion, the reason why I want to revise my set of rules for making new friends as mentioned before is that there seem to be people who violate the rules. They are just cool enough to make friendships with; they can\u0026rsquo;t stay just \u0026ldquo;people,\u0026rdquo; they need to be \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; And they already have the same amount of admiration as my friends, but I\u0026rsquo;m yet to call them \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; This nonsense happens for a lot of reasons; let\u0026rsquo;s list some:\nThe experiences I went through in making friends were very long in terms of duration, and this is purely by chance. My very first friends took a long time to call them friends — years. This was reflected in some way in my subsequent experiences (I started to consider taking more time just as how my first friendships took more time to bond). This might be nonsense, but that means even if someone passed the checklist in under six months, and they were finally qualified to be \u0026ldquo;friends,\u0026rdquo; without a year or two passing by, I can\u0026rsquo;t call them friends.\nIn simple terms, the way I formed friendship was that I get to know people very slowly and we disappear for years in the middle. This reflected that I don\u0026rsquo;t make people friends easily.\nAnother reason is to be mindful of the greater good we are serving. This is very common in relationships of University and Work because there is often a greater purpose that must be served and is compromised the moment we call ourselves \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; A good example would be a woman called Samar Yahia. Samar ages me by about ten years. We were co-founders of a startup at some point, and we just met. I never knew who she was, she knew who I am, and we never met to this very day although we live in the same city. Why? Simply because we prioritize the greater good of the startup by being co-founders/co-workers. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a great time; we had amazing conversations, laughter, we shared experiences and life lessons, we allowed ourselves to enjoy the process, and never made it boring. But let\u0026rsquo;s just not take it to the next level of being friends even if it feels right. If I ever get the chance to meet Samar in an alternative world, we would have been great friends, or if we had something other than work.\nThe last one is that I want to protect either myself or someone by not going to be a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; and it is better to have walls between. An example would be: Ahmed is a cool new freshman at the university, and I want to take him under my wings by making friendship with him, aka investing emotions. But I might not do that. Although he passed the checklist and is now a good candidate, I might prefer to keep the default relationship (colleague) assigned to him. Why? Well, since he is too young, I’m not sure if by this sudden access to all sorts of amusement and ideologies, he will remain the one I hoped to make friendship with. This way I can protect myself from making friendships with Ahmed. Another pattern that happens a lot, is the other way around: University colleagues try to get to know me outside the University, and they are often pushed by walls I build to protect them from me. I don’t want them to invest their emotions in me because I don’t see myself as trustworthy, that I\u0026rsquo;m not someone they can really rely on, and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust myself to handle that responsibility, at least not yet. This way, I protect them (and many times hurt them) using the walls I build and keeping them away from my friends zone, and most importantly, keep myself away from their friends zone.\nAt the end, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just a traumatized kid formalizing all these rules to make friendship. In reality, I don\u0026rsquo;t really suffer from this. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m good at reaching out to people and making friendships. I don\u0026rsquo;t struggle to communicate with people or get what I want. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a bad time searching for quality time. And thinking about how much worse it could be without these rules, I remind myself to be grateful.\nWhat kind of walls do you mean exactly?\nThe first one, I assume, is to act ordinary (which is a product of the walls but it\u0026rsquo;s just the first fence), acting ordinary is to not reveal the basic information about me, my name, my age, what I do in life. But this layer is fragile, once I\u0026rsquo;m asked, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind answering, it helps me save time and avoid making unnecessary relationships, I can\u0026rsquo;t count the amount of cool and bad people I could have made in life if I had never had this first wall which I now call the fence (it assumes acting dumb while knowing, being nonchalant while I\u0026rsquo;m a bit interested(this one started to fading recently I gotta get my shit together), sharing misguided information about me).\nThe most important wall is the privacy wall. I only allow a certain amount of information to get leaked from what I\u0026rsquo;m doing in my life. What I want to do. I\u0026rsquo;m not giving or sharing what violates my privacy. this includes (my family, my moves, my trips, my quality time, my free time, my friends, my performance, my upside-downs)\nless in height, subtle insecurities I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to involve people in.\n","title":"Adding new friends system","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"To nerd out and talk about a particular topic that you are deeply interested in/ obsessed with, requires you to unveil part of yourself. Your personality, your affection, your love for that topic. Often, it feels like dancing in the symphony of that subject(my analogy is very consumed, but I feel it holds true here).\nWhile jumping between discussions on Substack , I found myself watching this Kurt Vonnegut lecture.\nWatch the lecture Although I enjoyed the whole presentation, I was most impressed by his performance in the final minutes, the way he left the stage, his funny moves and gestures. This wasn’t unique to the ending, though. The way he spoke and carried himself throughout the lecture was “unique.”\nUnique to him.\nIt felt like this was how his soul interpreted information or felt about it, how it reacted to the joy of sharing his inner reasoning and experiences. You could sense the years of thought and accumulation behind every word. The jokes, the gestures, the rhythm, they were all expressions of his love for what he was saying.\nI found myself imagining a kind of paradise around the idea that he was never ashamed of being himself. Because when you look at him, he was doing weird stuff, awkward moves, overly specific jokes, yet the audience loved it. They understood and accepted his (uniqueness soon will be called awkwardness). They even craved it.\nuniqueness is just him being true to himself, acting natural and manifesting what he feels in the way he likes\nif this uniqueness exists in an alternative world, a world where he couldn’t be himself freely, where his natural self would be judged as strange akward. where his uniqueness is akwardness.\nWatching him leave the stage while everyone clapped, appreciating what he had shared, reminded me of how many intellectuals from my country travel abroad to pursue their careers in the United States or other Western nations that seem to value what they can offer.\noften saying,\nMy skills were welcomed in the country of Uncle Sam.\nThis isn’t about how the United States has built the perfect habitats for nerds and anyone who wants to be themselves; by embracing people as they are and shaping social norms around tolerance, rather than judgment.\nIt’s more about how bad I feel coming from regions where being your true self is misunderstood, misused, and simpy is a crime.\nAt that particular moment, watching him leave the stage, I remembered how unlucky we are for not growing up in environments that encourage us to nerd out, to share the things we are obsessed with in our own way, or even to share them at all.\nYou don’t know how many times I’ve tried to have deep discussions with people who are truly good at something(they are nerds about particular subject), just to crack through their insecurities and show them:\n“I’m a good listener.

You know you’re obsessed with it deep down — and there’s no reason to feel guilty about that with me.”\nCracking those defense walls is never easy.\nAnd it’s not their fault.\nIt’s the world they were born into, one that never prioritized who they truly are.\n","title":"Where You Are Allowed To Be You","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/where_you_are_allowed_to_be_you/"},{"content":"When making decisions in life, especially when we are faced with selecting between two events, we find ourselves comparing how important they are in order to determine which event we should choose. Some people study the implications of each decision and measure how rewarding or penalizing the outcomes might be. Picking the least penalty is a tactic for choosing a decision under this scenario.\nI first encountered this three years ago in one of Jeff Bezos’s interviews. he called it the Regret Minimization Framework. This tactic can be used on a smaller scale, even in daily decisions like getting out of bed or not. I’m sure you’ve used this tactic today in your own decision making process as a kind of mental tool. Usually, it helps me clarify priorities and take action with confidence. But what I’m here to share is a funny story: for the very first time, I was unable to use this utility in my decision making process.\nTwo events were taking place in the same hour block the next morning (8:00 AM). To make a decision, I defaulted my brain to use the regret minimization method. Unfortunately, the two events were equally likely in their consequences, at least from what my mind could list. Of course, life can have consequences that shows the advantages of one selection over the another, but I’m yet to know this and I need to make decisions under what I only know, and able to consider at the particular time I’m given this.\nIt felt exactly like how mathematical reasoning falls apart when dividing by zero, or how classical physics fails to explain things at small scales. This dilemma, of having two equally important events with either equally likely outcomes or vague consequences, made the regret minimization method fail completely. And honestly, that was a funny realization, because I’m rarely hesitant in making decisions. I know exactly what if I want to make a decision over another.\nMaybe I expected too much from this method,or misused it,but that’s not really the point I want to highlight. Perhaps this reflection doesn’t offer a grand piece of wisdom, but you can still take something from it: explore new ways of making decisions in your own life. Experiment with frameworks or tactics that help you choose the optimal option more often. And most importantly, pick an option, don’t stay up until (3:42 AM) like me, still undecided and unable to sleep.\n","title":"The Limits of the Regret Minimization Framework","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_limits_of_the_regret_minimization_framework/"},{"content":" Everyone is atheist until the plane starts falling. I have no clue who said this.\nThe numerous different stories that act as catalysts for returning to God and thinking about the existence of a grand designer or creator, shared by people across the globe, are interesting. There are a variety of patterns, and often the most interesting ones are those concluded through epistemic rationality rather than convenience or bias—where there was evidence that God existed, for them. One pattern is how God existed in everyday life. A good example is the historical belief that the creation of all temples and religions around the world throughout history is an innate, lowkey, subtle need for God.\nAnd this is what I’m interested in pulling strings from and building upon—what I felt right before I sleep. I’m not diving into theology, but rather sharing a concept I just coined: “Gratitude Register.” This is what I assume as the “where I find God” in my “everyday life pattern.” No matter what beliefs I’m holding or how religious or spiritual I am at a particular point in time, at the end of the day (literally) I find myself accounting for what was good today and in my life. This happens by default; it’s the way your psyche validates the day, your memory works, and you yourself try to make sense of all the nonsense you were doing throughout the day. Depending on how I define good (which of course includes biased beliefs or definitions from religion), I can bring different combinations of them. Now, if these things outweigh the misfortunes I have, that means it is a good day (again, there is no agreed upon way of defining and measuring misfortunes). Hence, some positive feelings may start to appear—one that stands out so loudly is gratitude. This feeling is a well known visitor, outshining others through its powerful urge.\nGratitude: “I’m here.” Translation: I’m grateful. Gratitude: “I need to make a decision so fast (urge).” Translation: I need to be grateful “for someone.”\nTranslation is what the mind tells about the chemicals.\nThis urge—and the small space I get to make the decision to fill it with someone—is what makes gratitude such a special “positive feeling.” This is how I translate it as a way to know God, and I’m feeling it every day. To know this Gratitude Register (just like how a CPU register is filled quickly and needs to assign the value to some process) requires some form of mental allocation.\nIf it happens and if I’m a full time atheist (I don’t wish that for anyone) I believe this interaction, of validating my day and unconsciously inviting “gratitude” as a result of just being human, shall rescue me from muddle and may guide me toward the light.\nThis is a piece of my honest and truthful analysis of my feelings toward gratitude.\n","title":"Gratitude Register","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/gratitude_register/"},{"content":" do things badly\nAs the years pass by, I find myself adapting to different reasons to keep living, and to share, I\u0026rsquo;m not as clear as I used to be about why I should be posting something publicly, but looking back over the years, I recall how writing started. How reasons changed.\nThe Seeds of Writing I\u0026rsquo;ve had amazing language teachers (Tahia and Jamal), who encouraged me to write and read since I was a little I\u0026rsquo;ve been under the wings of people who are naturally good at writing (this probably influenced me, I mean, I used to write poetry when I was a little) I felt the need to express my feelings through writing (I\u0026rsquo;ve been actively journaling since 8th grade) I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen in love with quotes and I became a collector at some point, they seemed to explain the world, so I started crafting my own through writing (High school/teenager period) I\u0026rsquo;ve wished people could write more about their experiences and not generic content When I needed someone to talk about Computer Science from their heart, experience, and not what they have studied Reem\u0026rsquo;s blog was my savior, and then later I loved the writings of Mohammed Yousif especially the self-reflection notes, and his feelings. I wanted to document my journey in life, I wished that the elderly people in my life had books/blogs that they had left behind for me, so I can get to know them more, even after they\u0026rsquo;re gone. I wanted to make sense of my doings, I would write the task I should be doing for myself to see if I understand the procedure that is supposed to happen, and if there are any subtle pitfalls in my understanding I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of. Yes, these are all different reasons, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how I\u0026rsquo;m going to organize them, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to overthink this.\nDemons but I got demons\u0026hellip;. that were holding me from writing.\nI get amazed by the number of clicks I write on the keyboard everyday writing something. and it is really fascinating how I barely share it publicly. I\u0026rsquo;m not in my best to recall the WHY behind why I\u0026rsquo;ve been skeptical about this, but below are what I can list now:\nBeing busy is the biggest factor for not sharing it publicly, not that I can\u0026rsquo;t press post/publish but that I have a cognitive overload from being busy, I get to experience and learn lesson on the fly which I assume its a bless. but it comes in huge numbers and sometimes hard to unpack what I\u0026rsquo;ve learn. so they time between me taking the lesson and preparing to share the lesson spans, if I assigned a name to this period, lets say C, there will even more lessons that will pop in that period which lead to me giving up completely on sharing.\nNot making sense of how this would help me. there was a time where I\u0026rsquo;ve had lost the meaning and I was blinded by something that I don\u0026rsquo;t know, the prevented me from seeing how this can help me in any way (practically speaking, yes I had reasons to write but not to share)? (later I found some reasons to share).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the writing tools: at that age being afraid is the default, I was telling myself if that x human is better than you at writing and knows how why would you still share? they got the experience, they got the talent, the got the time, they got the confidence. looking to back to how small I was to start such a thing makes sense.\nDo people call it a comfort zone?: I recall in 2023-2025 I stopped a number of my social media accounts repeatedly, until this very day, I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet posted one single status on my main WhatsApp account. And months can pass without sharing something publicly, now this has its own story, but it was one big reason that I\u0026rsquo;ve felt comfort in not being in public/ in not sharing, even if that is on social media.\nPrioritize what\u0026rsquo;s important: there is also a time when I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at the words that I\u0026rsquo;m writing, and that I should be sharing, but not to everyone, maybe I can do this to my closest people first, family, and friends. They deserve better, someone who is not being busy, but being responsive and collaborative. So throughout the last 2 years, I was investing more in my closest circle.\nDetails and setup: everyone has their own unique way of communicating, with mutual culture you get to say what you want smoothly (by smoothly I mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t face difficulties in deciding what to say and the recipient is not having trouble interpreting your words to what you actually meant) if we were to imagine how deviated I\u0026rsquo;m from that line, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not as close. maybe in reality I can relate and talk to people, but inside my head I overthink and over-engineer what I should say to the person in-front of me based on the data they are directly or indirectly steaming to me, will they relate to what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, are they comfortable talking about this, are they going to feel offended, am I talking fast, and not showing them the point, did I match their energy/slang, was the conversation interactive?, dozens of questions, now image you are talking to over thousand person, thats what I put in my mind and heart before sharing anything publicly. Now these details are hard to overcome.\nI\u0026rsquo;m wasting my time here: this is a real demon here, it tells me that the time I would spend in writing and then responding to people\u0026rsquo;s comments, inquiries, friendships, rituals out of curiosity about me from my posts, can be dedicated to doing something more useful, I would spend more time doing more important things maybe.\nmoving forward This blog website is an attempt; it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be the last one, but I have faith in it.#\n","title":"Why I’m Sharing Notes","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-do-this/"},{"content":" Early to rise early to bed, makes a man healthy but socially dead\nOne thing that i\u0026rsquo;m sure about is, that I don\u0026rsquo;t miss people easily, not that I don\u0026rsquo;t bare people, or I\u0026rsquo;m antisocial. but I keep myself busy to the point I forget about the people, I feel sorry for myself and for the people I know that I\u0026rsquo;m emotionally inactive when I need it.

I thank Allah for blessing me to live this long. Those first 21 years were upheavals.\nI grew up playing video games and memorizing/reciting Quran under the mentorship of Shiekha Entisar, my best friend’s mother. I had the chance to pursue an education. Even though I was a high performer, I scored only average on entrance exams and never paid attention to my academic pursuits during the bottleneck years that mattered the most.\nLately I learned to love my family and friends. I also learned to dislike certain kinds of people. I’ve been listening, whether I’m interested or not, because it always helps me understand more. And I’ve been keeping quiet during moments when I had so much to speak up.\nI have been, and to some point still am, a generalist.

As a result of my constant consumption, I became socially awkward, developed IBS, and struggled with severe social anxiety.\n","title":"The First 20 years of my life in a nutshell","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/21_reflections/"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s May 6, and I will be turning 21 in less than a month. I used to document at this time of the year, where I try as much as possible to reflect on the progress made this year, perhaps my learning process. Alhamdullah, I have learned a lot. And I have tales to tell, but hopefully, choosing the most significant one will find a wider audience and fit. I will talk in 3s three categories and 3 notes\nI will talk about What I learned about the world What I learned about the people What I learned about myself. I\u0026rsquo;m not very visionary and dreamy, so I think about life directly, but here are some lessons that I learned.\nWhat you learn models the way you think. We try as much as possible to interpret the complexity of the world and answer the why and how behind things; the way we think and use our minds is completely different based on what we have learned, and dictates how we will view the world. If that\u0026rsquo;s chemistry, you will look at life as a chemical reaction, a mathematician viewing it as a melody of logic, a writer as stories, and so on.\nThe reality has nothing to do with your hope. Life is very unpredictable; you can\u0026rsquo;t say good things happen for good people, or I have put too much into this project hence it will succeed, life has nothing to do with your hope.\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t pursue happiness directly. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall when was the last time I heard someone asking whether you are happy or not, and how to be happy. It looks like everyone is suddenly not talking about happiness, which is good in my opinion. Happiness is something you pursue indirectly.\nhere comes the people. Unexpected Time Sink You respawned in this world hoping that you would spend most of the time doing what you love, but then you realized that a great portion of your time is dedicated to people, some of them whom you might like, and others you will force yourself to adapt wasting time with.\ncheerful face and sweet words You can get what you want with a cheerful face and sweet words: People hold positions, some of them control the valves of opportunities. What I found is, besides having the potential to fit the need, if you have reached out, cold emailed, or any sort of communication, people will help you make things out.\nPeople have feelings, I guess. They feel, every single action you do influences the way they look at you. If you never show up for their invitations, if you were a bit off that day, your tune changed. I fooled myself for a long time, thinking that people would never notice the small things that I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\nAbout me. Struggle to see things from their perspective I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I can\u0026rsquo;t fully understand someone else\u0026rsquo;s situation unless I have been through something similar or if I am able to simulate/mimic/imagine the same circumstances. For instance,, if I live in the big city of Khartoum with a 9 - 5 job anda regular pace of life, I will never be able to generalize what people might suffer from and what challenges they face in different parts of Sudan. I just can\u0026rsquo;t.\nKeeping up, what is that? I\u0026rsquo;m the worst when it comes to keeping up with people and the news. In order to feel natural and get along with most of today\u0026rsquo;s youth and even adults, you need to have a middle ground to talk about, in most cases, football, politics, and news, which I don\u0026rsquo;t really bother myself to follow. So this is one of the things I learned that I simply suck at bringing topics to the middle ground.\nAvoiding Regret I love video editing/storytelling, tho I\u0026rsquo;m not editing as much as I used to, but it\u0026rsquo;s still one of the things that I loved doing naturally and unconditionally. I never admit to saying it verbally, but the reason I\u0026rsquo;m making videos is to capture a snapshot of time, just like git versions the code. The main incentive behind doing this action. is to avoid regret. I can\u0026rsquo;t live with this burden in my chest. There are dozens of videos that I discarded, many of which I\u0026rsquo;ve never started. Tens of drafts have never seen the light, and a bit over 50 were sent privately to the once i trust the most. so my advice to you is.\n","title":"21","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/21/"},{"content":"Things I was wrong about Recently, I came to the realization: I’m not giving people what they deserve. I don’t make it easy for them to stay close to me, not only strangers, but even the people who care about me the most. I build walls, my mood is forever changing around them, and constantly not around. And I know this is wrong. I noticed that at the beginning of relationships, I can match people’s energy effortlessly, but over time I gradually drift back into being distant and cold. It feels unfair, it\u0026rsquo;s hypocrisy. either I shouldn’t appear friendly in the first place, or I should remain consistent with the way I start. which is being friendly forever.\nCRM when thinking about these problems, I found out I was not up to the promises I tell myself, although I want to check on people I love from time to time, I don\u0026rsquo;t do that, I just can\u0026rsquo;t maintain it, I fail every time, I recently came to the term, Customer Relation management where business people keep track of their customers, and found a video that talks about applying this idea into tracking your social life.\nWhen I thought about these problems, I realized I wasn’t living up to the promises I made to myself.

I’m not the best at making analogies, but I will tell the story of stochastic processes and my conversation with Zainab. She’s a Computer Science major who devoted more time and effort to mathematics while also maintaining good grades in CS related subjects. She shared me the work of a mathematician in stochastic processes after winning a Nobel prize on his word, or Fields Medal I really can’t recall it. we were arguing about how he managed to imagine these things, let alone architecting a framework to explain it, Although we tried to “wonder” but we come from completely different backgrounds, as I see stochastic processes from practical Machine Learning point of view, mainly thinking of “if I never set a random seed I might never reproduce my same results again, my weights will always initialize randomly, the gradient will always give different results/trough when minimizing the cost function”, Zainab is coming from a completely different background thinking about the mathematics how differential equations are implemented…etc.\nThis idea of things being as you imagine them, or as the image you are able to craft by generalizing from previous experiences, is something I often think about.\nHow to benefit from this lesson. Assuming you want to study a material in a new subject that you have never studied before, you will have generalization ability to predict how it\u0026rsquo;s going to be, but the reality might be different. and sure it is different, from the things that you can think of, it is always better to do the process to know how things are. quantum mechanics seems like you will be imagining where the cat is, what will happen if I observe it, but in reality, you will be doing differential equations, which will shape the framework of how you think about these problems. So this might let you think twice that THINGS ARE NOT AS YOU IMAGINE them, don’t let your assumptions fool you.\nInstead, it should be a part of your learning process, when you hit the realization of what actually this topic is talking about, for a very long time, I thought calculus is about calculation, after reading it I knew that it was talking about the rates of changing, and now I view as the art of dealing with tight spaces, and I will keep changing my assumption about it as I go, or maybe adding to the previous once. so having this flexibility will always help.\n","title":"What you want to major in might not be exactly what you imagine it to be","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/what_you_want_to_major_in_might_not_be_exactly_how_you_imagine_it/"},{"content":"Lately, I lost my ability to focus and maintain a flow state.

Sleeping early (70%) The percentage here indicates the importance of the action and how it contributes to the focus during the day, sleeping early isn’t new to me, I noticed that not doing this step, will degrade my performance (mentally \u0026amp; physically) particularly mentally, the physical condition can be refreshed after 1:00 PM or in the middle of the day, but the mentally is ever lasting throughout the day. But doing this step alone (i.e, validating how just sleeping early can affect your focus/performance) is not highly rewarding; it’s more of a prevention than a boost, which prevents you from having a bad day/focus rather than boosting you with flow state.\n1. Waking up early(90%) Now this is the most important part, sleeping early is not enough, you need its complement, which is waking up early, whether you slept at 9:00 PM or 12:00 AM\nWaking up early always makes it better to concentrate.\n","title":"Flow State and Sleep","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/flow_state_and_sleep/"},{"content":"I once read:\n“one of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know, someone in your class might find your presence inviting and warm even if you’ve exchanged a few words with them or maybe none at all, someone on the street loves your smile and it brightens their path for the next few blocks, someone who regularly comes to work is disappointed when you aren\u0026rsquo;t there, someone missed you today, someone noticed when you’re gone, someone loves you when you’re there, someone loves you when you’re nowhere to be found at all, you might think you have always disappeared when you’re no longer in the picture, but you never left the frame”\nAs far as I remember, this quote is the very reason I no longer question why people might feel my existence in their lives is adding value.

Unlike my previous answers, which were showing independent personality and actions that didn’t need the “people” in their space.

I have experienced life and responsibilities, but surely the 20s will be different, and I tried to answer one question: what am I afraid of? Why I’m afraid of being 20: and it turns out it is not only one question,but I was filled with lots of questions:\nWhat do I want to do for the rest of my life? What do I want to keep? What do I want to quit? Who will I stay with? Which people would I leave? Will I be able to practice my hobbies as the time I need to make videos and pursue my cinematography projects? What would happen to the way I think? Will my beliefs keep helping me?

And it will come back to me. I’m turning 20 next week. Here are some lessons I think I learned in my teens, I may change my mind about some of them in the future.\nYour family must be no.1 priority in your life. You must have one thing that your life revolves around(Religion, category of people). People are not good at understanding themselves. Being Busy can prevent you from doing stupid things, and at the same time from good things, make sure to balance. Sleep early and wake up early. Don’t create competitions that doesn’t exist, be realistic. You can explore life in your teens and 20s and be a generalist, but set a limit for that and try to specialize and focus on the important parts. Routine is the small steps you take towards every big goal you set for yourself. A good level of understanding yourself, is knowing what you are not good at. If you’re a junior and you think you are smarter than an old outdated seniors, think twice; they have experience. Someone may find your presence warm and lovely without you knowing, so always be kind. If people do like you and you don’t know why, try to know why and keep practicing this thing for the rest of your life. Memories are the most warm feeling in the world, and the time you’re remembering them, will always be a happy time. I guess Happening is something that you pursue indirectly. Pray to Allah for giving you a clear mind, and practice exercise, eliminate distractions and you will have super flow state. Our beliefs are changing every time and we probably notice that late. If you ever felt happy for no reason try to ask yourself why? Write it down and read it when you’re down. Being optimistic about something and putting massive emotions into it doesn’t mean it will succeed. Reality is just independent of your thoughts Sad, or in pain? This will always come back at some point; you gotta use the time you have when you’re at your best. You may hurt people without knowing that you did, so you need to make sure you apologize frequently and ask people about how you behave. Chasing one thing will make the other things run away, like chasing a job but your health is in danger. You can be good at anything, including research and engineering, without a university, but the university is still important. We are not alike in the way we receive new information and knowledge; some know how to extract every possible information out of it, while others don’t. Mainstream titles like “entrepreneurship” can wait, and people who are seeking it since early ages of their career or uni want only the money, but they don’t have the needed skills and capacity to be the one. You may be good at using one of the technologies that uses scientific methods, but till you should always be humble to that outdated professor who spends his life solving equations and teaching math that you see as useless. You just didn’t realize the importance of it yet and the impact he is having. Avoid blaming your family members ","title":"20","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/20/"},{"content":"One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on Facebook , not consistently, and then I went through what I called “ Manulasis ”(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.\nThis happened because of the overwhelming number of times I discarded posts, notes, videos, or images I intended to share. Eventually, I gave up and abandoned the whole idea, and in doing so, I vanished from reality. This hesitation wasn’t new to me; I’ve been repeating this pattern since childhood. I would have sudden peaks of exposing my thoughts to the world, followed by long troughs of detachment and isolation. The amount of life that happens during those troughs makes it difficult to say everything when I finally try to reconnect with the world again.\nIf I turn a blind eye to the complexity, one of the strongest incentives behind sharing my notes is the fear of regret . I have been running from this feeling most of my life. The idea that all the messages, reflections, and thoughts I discarded will haunt me in the future terrifies me. This fear is closely tied to the feeling of standing on the Day of Judgment, knowing I had something that might help someone, but I never shared it. Recording what I’ve learned is a way to pass something forward to future generations.\n","title":"Why Im Sharing Notes - Regret","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-im-sharing-notes-regret/"},{"content":" There\u0026rsquo;s an anecdote about Richard Feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on Mr Feynman desk and makes a comment about these being a record of Feynman\u0026rsquo;s thinking and then Mr Feynman corrects the historian and says that: these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you\u0026rsquo;re thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that\u0026rsquo;s when Mr Feynman says: no they aren\u0026rsquo;t a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.\nIf I were to say the most important feature of making my life interpretable, it would be writing. I make sense of what is changing in my life through my writing, publicly, I don’t mention exciplicitly what is changing, but instead I just write. mostly about my beliefs, what I value, and the challenge I’m facing at the time. I do it multiple times throughout the year, and just by comparison, I can tell what changed. This self-reflection can help me distinguish between actual growth and commitments I made due to bad experiences, whether I adopted sudo-nihilism to cope with misfortunes, or if my pace in learning is slow and the road is very steep. All sorts of learnings in my journey are coming from my writings.\nAround 2018, I and Abd Alwahab Were arguing about some existential questions as teenagers while walking along the train track in the borders of our little small town district of Al-Daroshab , I came up with the realization that all the people who have died, are unable in anyway to share the lessons they have learned, not even as single lesson. through any channel. I remember that I never stopped talking about that idea with him that day. Years later, after deepening my understanding of our religion, Islam, the importance and encouragement of knowledge sharing, and the intolerance of not sharing knowledge.\nAlthough the priority is sharing the Islamic teachings and standing beside what is right. But I found that sharing small, minor details of our lives might be valuable. Scarcity of information: I was lucky that I was provided with an abundance of resources and access to people whom I can ask questions. I was raised having a computer, a brother to guide me through the installation of translators and IDEs on my machine, although he only just told me the names, but I was born lucky to some extent. I couldn’t even comprehend the idea of thinking about how my life would have been without having access to all the people and information. What I learned as a child significantly influenced the person I have become today. I never had the chance to appreciate this. Until a later period of my life, when I noticed a pattern of how the availability of information can lead to different lives.\nIn my primary-schooling period, I was smarter than most kids in “Computer” lessons and labs. And the teachers always ask me the following questions\n“Where did you learn this from?” or “Does your father come from an IT background?” so there must be a source of information, as they are assuming there is a light that must have guided you. something that sparked the first interest. That has led you to the person you are today. The same question is being repeated to students who are excelling in math (I suck at math), and looking back after I investigate them, they also had some sort of access to information (private tutor, aspirations, someone recommended a book for them), and so on.\nA model to understand information sharing. During my last year in high school, I started to view the world as a big network of knowledge/information sharing. I teach you computer science subject(what I use to do) and Abdalrahman (Math nerd who used to teach us mathematics) no matter how you are good in one subject you will always need help from different people, who are either in the same specialization that you’re looking for help with, or something else, This result of this processing of sharing information is to facilitate lives.\nWhat is wisdom does it have something to do with Making life much easier: I remember taking a consultation from Ali Azam one day about what university to pick, he told me that the university you’re going to pick will determine your next five years if not having a contribution to your whole life. He guided me through how its not just the name and reputation of the university but also the city where you live and ..etc a very concise definition of wisdom that I developed is: better decision making.\nAs I see many people are thinking about wisdom that same way as knowledge and whenever they heard the world a wise man they imagine someone who’s moving around with 200 IQ and quote to say everywhere. They ignore the fact that a wise man not only knowing but make actions and decisions based on his information.\nIf you zoom into your lifespan you would find there is this one component of decision making that significantly influenced your life today/the person who you are.\nThese decision are sometimes big ; whether to continue education or not, sometimes small; should I read today or play, the word decision is not about just being prompt to select between 2 or multiple choices, but it’s what you’re doing everyday you’re unconsciously calculate if you are going to sleep early or not whether you want to skip your leg day or study… etc\nEvery decision matter, not making a choice is also a choice\nThings I feel sorry about: One of the things I felt would make my life so much easier is knowing how to do math. Throughout my schooling period, I never encountered a math teacher who encouraged me to love math or helped me to do it; they did the exact opposite, except for the statistics and probability experience. And no wonder I love statistics more.\nWhen I entered university, I had to deal with all the previous experiences that had affected me. The access to top-tier students helped me make better decisions based on what they have experienced from success, failures, for instance, my senior Zainab helped me significantly understand math structure, and that I lack prerequisites for some courses.\nThis information sharing resulted in making my life easier. Sure, the math I had to deal with wasn’t easy, but in the hope of making this decision of going back to prerequisites, no matter how hard it is, it made my life later easier.\nI have seen people who never stop talking, but I couldn’t mine any useful information that would facilitate my life, while with little chatting with the most introverted person in the room, I can get advice that I never had the chance to know about.\nI shared my experiences in multiple aspects of life, whether it\u0026rsquo;s something big like joining a computer science school or not, or minor like recommending a software.\nWhile I was scared people would make a decision based on my experience, I kept emphasizing the idea that they should use the information they obtained from me as a data point, not final words, and it\u0026rsquo;s based on my experience, I try as much as I can to be unbiased and to tell what matches their needs. sometimes I receive messages from people saying that the decision they made has led a successful results, AKA make their lives so much easier. which I found very fascinating. most people who can help with information will be hesitant to share it, and even the failure when sharing it can be used as a decision making by someone else; this is basically how our lives work.\nThe reason why I’m writing these articles is the hope that there is someone who will make use of them in one way, taking a single idea that would inshallah help make their life easier.\n","title":"Why I'm Sharing Notes — Learned Too Late","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why_im_sharing_notes/"},{"content":"Progress: One of the good things I lack in my life is receiving feedback. Usually, everyone assumes that I’m an expert at everything, and they tend to define the way of our communication based on my social presence (oh, that’s Ahmed, everyone likes this dude. he is amazing… etc) while the reality is significantly different. I know several quality skills, like anyone, without having superpowers, I know how to speak, communicate, but I guarantee you I’m not the best!, and there is alot that you don\u0026rsquo;t know about me.\nThe problem is the iconography that the presenters who lead conversations/first time meets tend to define me with! They overglorify my story and the person I am, and this is not serving me in any way. The smarter the presenter will present you, the more independent you are likely to become.\nAnd that was always the case: people treated me based on what they heard about me, and probably that was brighter in a way that blinded what they would hear from me later. All my attempts to correct that, are prone to failure.\nFeedbacks! In the early days of the university, the first feedback I got from my colleagues where something like; You look like a robot, you don’t seem to know what feelings are. And indeed, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing my best at camouflaging as a human, although I was good at communication, but people always felt lost finding the way to enter my sphere. So I decided to be more friendly, and I took it so seriously, it brought some results in many different aspects. But the feedbacks are gone, the compass I used to make the decision based on is no longer here.\n","title":"Lack of Real Feedback","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/lack_of_real_feedback/"},{"content":"I remember coming back to Sudan from Saudi Arabia when Abd Alwahab told me he had secured a scholarship in India and might travel to pursue it. After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.\nOne day, I visited him at home and saw him packing up his bags, and some of his luggage was already packed. I was slightly irritated. he was so happy about his future, and I was happy for him too. Two years ago, I remember watching a video he shot that day, looking at myself, I could see how drowned I was in my thoughts, completely silent. Not many days passed before he booked his flight tickets.\nI went to the airport feeling completely numb . I even remember that my sister drove me, although I insisted on riding alone. I tried to make sure his journey went smoothly, helped him with the procedures, and it wasn’t long before I saw him hugging his family. That day, I didn’t grieve silently; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold myself. When he came to hug me one last time, I cried like a child. It was the most terrible feeling I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn’t stop myself from crying. I cried the entire way back home, at home, and again the next morning.\nFor the first time, my feelings rushed without control, without regulation, without avoidance; I got to see how vulnerable I was. With everything I had repressed before, the very distinct thought in my head was translated as: “I don’t know what to do with my life anymore.” It felt like I had lost myself. It felt like there was an important definition in my life that was suddenly gone. Even though the tears subside, writing this was never easy. I’ve tried to interpret what happened that day many times before, but most of the time I avoided thinking about it. Even now, while writing this, remembering it makes me cry like a child.\nThe days after he left were empty. I felt depressed and had no motivation to do anything. This eventually developed into severe social anxiety . I dragged myself into a cycle of illnesses and panic attacks that didn’t stop.\nFor almost four years, I hid my pain from him, how the days felt when he wasn’t around. I focused on how happy he seemed exploring a new world. I wanted to match his happy feelings, but two months ago, during a FaceTime call, the conversation suddenly shifted to the day he left. I was triggered and cried like a child again. I had never healed from the emotions I kept avoiding; they were always there, repressed.\nit was a goodbye I never recovered from, that particular departure triggered years of anxiety I was subconsciously avoiding by keeping myself busy, I miss you more than you can imagine, my friend. Not having you around was the hardest thing I ever had to go through.\n","title":"The Moment I Realized What He Meant to Me","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-moment-i-realized-what-he-meant-to-me/"},{"content":" your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.\nIt’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.\nAvoidant attachment is a pattern where you feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness and tend to pull away or shut down when relationships start to feel too vulnerable. Deep down, you may still want connection, but it feels safer to stay distant, guarded, or independent.\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of this term “Avoidant attachment,” and it is crazy how accurately it sums up and explains the recurrence of my patterns, Adding new friends systems , Elaborate Adding new friends system On avoidant attachment after watching videos about this topic, I felt it’s relevant to what I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing, and I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how mature psychology is, to the point of describing such a phenomenon. Below I will paste a comprehensive summary that can help understand the avoidant personality in a nutshell, and build on top of its light.\nYour avoidant isn\u0026rsquo;t fine, they\u0026rsquo;re just numb, to you it registers as indifference, what if they\u0026rsquo;re gone, what if they\u0026rsquo;re done, what if they\u0026rsquo;re over this, but internally on their part, it is an emotional shutdown. Avoidant don\u0026rsquo;t walk away calm, they walk away frozen, they don\u0026rsquo;t process in the moment, they don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened. They retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection. They are avoiding the emotional bill that just hasn\u0026rsquo;t hit them yet, because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them early, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them after a day or after a week, it hits them later on. When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone, and when they think that you have stopped expecting anything from them, that is the moment that it hits them. That\u0026rsquo;s when they start remembering the moment that they hurt you. And that\u0026rsquo;s when they finally feel what you felt in real time.\nThis piece is the first to encounter when searching for what this term means. I find it very accurate to the point I feel discomfort that there is someone out there is able to describe me in words, to have the words and explanation that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have, that I was searching for almost my entire life. I can see my own patterns here, by distilling this piece:\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened This explains the selective ignorance that I adapt\nthey retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection, this explains many of my disappearances because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame, all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you,this explains my writing state of numbness When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone; this explains why I avoided establishing direct relationship (closeness), and decided to use society buckets On the harm I caused others For a long time I believed I\u0026rsquo;m just not build for relationships, the moment someone brings emotions to our conversation I pull away, there is this poor Jonior whom I met recently and the moment he told me: “you\u0026rsquo;re cool, I like you, we could be friends”,As soon as he said that, I completely withdrew. and vanished from his life. Earlier this year I was talking to my friend Omer Monir. on how I’ve abundant the idea of romantic relationships in my life. Due to reasons I failed to interpret at the time, but the idea of I myself avoiding it, is a huge factor. What scares me the most about all sorts of relationships is the closeness and the commitment it brings, I can\u0026rsquo;t show up everyday, I\u0026rsquo;m terrified and not familiar with the intimacy that comes with establishing relationships, I run, I pull away and I shut down emotionally the moment these start to happen,\nthis explains why I freaked out when recently one of the uni colleagues told me I\u0026rsquo;m their best friend, I froze, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what did I respond with, he was so polite when he added the words “but I understand that you\u0026rsquo;re always busy and you don\u0026rsquo;t text too much, but I know that you\u0026rsquo;re a good man”, I was left speechless, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t say a word, I felt the guilt of how I\u0026rsquo;m not able to love them back the way they loved me. but at the end a person will only love you to the capacity in which they\u0026rsquo;re able to love themselves. I\u0026rsquo;ve failed many people before; they were victims of my avoidance, This dialogue helps me to imagine the kind of stress I put those people under.\nI\u0026rsquo;m being too much, the replies are getting colder, shorter, it\u0026rsquo;s like they don\u0026rsquo;t even care at all anymore, now I\u0026rsquo;m starting to freak out, because the only person I wanna talk to, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m interrupting them or I\u0026rsquo;m disturbing them, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m a burden, like I\u0026rsquo;m unwelcomed. Did I do something wrong, am I pushing them away, because they are not giving me the same energy that they did, I just want them to notice, I just want them to remind me that I matter to them.\nI once wrote how I\u0026rsquo;m really not good at putting myself in the other people shoes , and how I fooled myself into thinking people won’t be affected by my own patterns but in reality, I have hurt people, a lot of them, and I keep hurting more, by avoiding them, by showing up randomly and disappear frequently. It’s a strange grief to realize the amount of wounded people not out of cruelty I exposed, but out of an instinct, a second nature I caught before I ever had the words for it. The grief is even harder to bear when thinking that some people didn’t walk away from me; they walked away from the waiting. From my patterns. I only learned the cost after the silence became permanent.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful that the things I wrote in the past are finally becoming clear to me. A lot of friends helped to see this part of myself, how avoidant I am, including my best friend AbdAlwahab, and a bunch of victims. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this to result in a behaviour change soon, but at least for now, I can recognize my own patterns. At least for now, everything made sense.\n","title":"Learning the Truth About How I Love","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/a_grief_i_didnt_expect/"},{"content":"This piece of writing was part of an article I’m writing, about how I would help someone answering the question of “what do I want to do”, where I discuss how to pick a major and what helps you to define the way you contribute to this world. I found the draft of the article to be very lengthy, I may expected the reader to be aware of difference notions upfront, so I preferred this topic to be referenced here. As many of my drafts are pointing to it.\nIntro I started by highlighting how chasing long horizon questions can lead to unnecessary complexity that you might not have the tooling to unpack currently\nIt is not in your interest to waste time on investigating how the educational system started and why I need to get a degree in the first place, but rather to admit and sign up to the terms and conditions of this life. It is in your interest to know how to make the best use of your free will, if it was not, by your parents or conditions, to choose what you want to do in life. That might, but not necessarily result in your enrollment in a related field at the university, considering a topic as your side hustle or ultimately your profession, more on this later.\nConsent to the game rules is what I love to call accepting how the systems work, and agreeing to the terms and conditions that are dictated by our modern societies and cultures. What I will count as an example is the generalist/polymath who would argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to pick a major, or they want to consume more than one major; this can result in abandoning the educational system or not taking it seriously. I will consume all arts and sciences until the line drawing these distinctions diminish, they say. Although this is a bold claim that no one dares to hold, people underestimate the amount of discipline they need to maintain in order to achieve what their perception wove.\nI always think of the American Constitution promoting the amendments about the division of labor that, in order for the nation/community to grow and help optimize the metrics for its greater good, economics, innovation, fast food, and the good things we have in our modern societies. People should be specialists.\nthis is more of a reality check that defines the way the world functions, if happens and you are one of those people buying the idea of being a generalist, I\u0026rsquo;m not telling you to drop the idea, but most importantly telling you you\u0026rsquo;re swimming against the odds by being a generalist, and that you need to make sure your good plan of becoming a generalist helps you and ultimately us in providing something meaningful to the world and it is not a recursion. not just illusions of being special. Although someone might argue that the future belongs to those who combine different skills, for now, this is an example of resistance in consenting to the game rules.\nConsenting to the game requires being able to make sense of why the world is the way it is, and to be ready to take off all the chains holding you back from starting to contribute to the world, wether this is despair of how much evil exists in the world, or confusion of how disorder the systems are, skepticism because if any of this real, or if my doings matter, these questions regarding the game of life need to be answered to finally consent with a rested heart after all the searching to the game rules.\nbut as you can see, most of these questions are philosophical, they are about meaning, existence, identity, things that you will naturally experience the moment you you\u0026rsquo;re conscious, others might require you to explore politics and economics, what you need to do is simple, to just believe in the idea of making tomorrow a better day, to Reduce your suffering. because this will help you in the pursuit of existential clarity, and will yield you will stamina to purse answers in different directions, this worth a standalone article but the gist of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying is, if you want to find answers to the questions you are having, you need to be good with whatever will serve you in making tomorrow a better day, the same way you are good with the language, out of its importance in describing the universe, you need to be good and welcome with the things that will minimize the complexity of your situations, having an initial faith you will be facing the game rules (The nonsense you don\u0026rsquo;t understand) and use it as instrument for better you. if this might still abstract I might indeed to write a standalone point.\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t be thriving and winning unless you stand and consent to the game rules. Staying the same and doing nothing will only make it worst, so we pick what is less painful; to get up and find answers, to contribute to humanity with what we will find.\nFinding Answers Some of these questions you need to answer in order to consent willingly to the game rules can take years, and this is definitely not the best case scenario, especially in your case, where you want more answers to forecast accurately. However, the best case scenario is to have the ability to be selectively ignorant,\nSelectively Ignorant If you can classify these kinda of questions that will drag you into an infinite loop, it is better to carry on your work by ignoring these questions and having their burden in the background, in the hope that they will be answered one day. This will help minimize the complexity of your decision-making. Selective ignorance is applied in different parts of my life; maybe I will write more about it in the future.\nThat Will do My second advice is not to overthink whether the answers you\u0026rsquo;ve got are optimal, or if it\u0026rsquo;s an answer that made you feel good. If it fits and helps you in the process of getting closer to start consenting to the game rules, then use them as placeholders. The unveiled insights and joy of consenting to the game are more rewarding than the value of time wasted searching for the optimal. Do not care about the sources, it can come from something minor as a random quoted message you read on some random street walls written by a heartbroken lover, that you will consider as the last piece of the puzzle, TEDx talk, discussion with a friend. university course, whether your sources were science, religion.

I hesitated to make new friendships , I hesitated to share my writings publicly .\nThe reason is I was, and to this very day concerned with the questions that deviated me from being socially active. One of these questions is:\nWhat happens to a young person’s expectations about life when most of what they see one the internet are idealized stories, overly wise, unrealistic narratives? What happens to my community if this is the kind of discussion being shared publicly, which is mostly unproductive, pointless, trivial, and hollow? Can I change this?\nI\u0026rsquo;m still young, actively consuming data from the world, learning, and constantly changing. Sharing my opinions is not making the world a better place, I\u0026rsquo;m sure whatever I write be deprecated by my constantly evolving beliefs . so why bother writing? the world has enough of people talking, saying they want to make it a better place. The world is full of people who are more \u0026ldquo;qualified\u0026rdquo; to talk than myself although no one listens to them. Writing random quotes on social media that can mean different things to different people, or sharing a meme that can help someone heal, was enough for me.\nThis hides the part of my life I don\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable revealing in lengthy stories and lessons. The problem is that the majority of people end up using social media as a self help book. They look up to people\u0026rsquo;s achievements to get inspired, craving stories that match their personal circumstances and challenges. People are subconsciously building a map about the world using what is shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X…\nAn example: someone doubting their journey in learning finance، feeling lost in the equations, thinking they’re \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo; because everyone else seems to master the math effortlessly and even automate process in software tools. What people don’t say is that doubt is normal, and many of these equations aren’t intuitive at all, hardly understood at any given time. and It’s okay to feel confused Another example . someone just learning software engineering opens LinkedIn and feels left behind because people post about how they can solve noble problems using data science and machine learning software 2.0 they say. They may feel others are more impactful, and build the statement \u0026ldquo;all people working in data science are impactful\u0026rdquo; while in reality, most of these are demo projects, graduation projects, or research ideas far from implementation. I experienced the same when I first accessed the internet, consuming materials that seemed ideal, perfect, true, valid ,but are far from reality.\nNot explicitly mentioning our imperfections, hiding them, does not help. Packaging them in memes, stories, or art might provide temporary comfort and company for someone receiving, but it might not be good in the long run. I see this as one of the factors contributing to people\u0026rsquo;s despair these days. We tend to package our social appearance with what we find worth showing. Of course, you won\u0026rsquo;t go out there showing people all the insecurities you have. Telling them how you overcome social anxiety, they believe its a myth, or how awkward your hobbies are, you will be judged harshly. A few people do this. But in searching for perfection, we forget the most natural attributes of being human: being present , being emotional, being wrong.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m about to talk publicly or post on social media, I overthink if my writing matches all backgrounds and ages of my audience, if people would think I\u0026rsquo;m insecure about something, and if my writing is solid. That\u0026rsquo;s why I mostly write short quotes, not sharing experiences, lessons, or opinions, and ultimately suppressing my emotions.\nLife isn’t a set of solutions Life isn\u0026rsquo;t made up of a set of solutions for you to find.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built on extreme behaviors you learn to balance.\nAs a result of not engaging fully socially I have mastered controlling and potentially suppressing my emotions; which led to numbness . eventually I lost the meaning and pleasure of sharing my experience. the silence of surviving a day that no one knew about was hard, but the comfort zone I build covered this. Other factors include I\u0026rsquo;m very good at keeping myself busy and having master\u0026rsquo;s degree in wearing custom masks. By letting myself speak more honestly, I’m not only helping myself grow; I’m giving something back to the people who read me. If I share things as they are not polished, not idealized I might open a small space for someone else to breathe, to doubt safely, to feel normal again. And maybe this is how I contribute: not by being perfect, but by being real when most people aren’t.\nNow, I need to learn the opposite: I need to engage, to care. I need to feel and to love. To enhance the quality of my life, I must show my true colors without abandoning myself.\nI must stop wearing masks and let the changes that happen to me show up in my behavior with people. This way I can know who truly loves me and whose concerns include my problems.\nPerfect time does not exist if you wait, until everything feels finished, you gonna miss the people who would have loved you exactly as you are.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve waited for a long time to get it right, to feel certain that I finally figured it all out. That I will have a good map of reality which can define ideal human interactions for me. But this never happened, and I might waste my life waiting. And planning.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give this a shot I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to read books, rush the process of writing and publicly sharing, spend hours consulting friends, and form smaller communities to test my ideas. Did they work? Not entirely, but they provided lessons and information. I have no clue if this is just one of those random 3:00 AM bursts of motivation or if I’m finally tired of my own patterns, but one thing is sure: life rewards actions more than intelligence. I have a preliminary outline of what I want to do, and I should not overthink and drown myself in inaction. I will fail, it\u0026rsquo;s okay. I\u0026rsquo;m freaking out while writing this, but the signs point me to try. I will share more because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. Sharing my uncertainty can help someone; sharing my doubts when learning something can make someone\u0026rsquo;s day better. Sharing my insecurities can bring me people who help me overcome them.\nIn the end Having these pieces of notions connected and understood took me a long time. Yesterday, I was vulnerable, unaware of what I write here. My writing is not perfect; I could have used wiser words. Blind spots, potential mistakes, and pitfalls await me, but I welcome them, and I welcome whoever helps me in my journey.\nFor what is a man what has he got If not himself then he has not To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way.\n","title":"Learning to Feel Again","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/learning_to_feel_again/"},{"content":"I had a friend I met online who struggled with social anxiety. He used to tell me how he panicked at the idea of going to the university. I knew he wasn’t lying, but part of me couldn’t truly believe it, that a psychological disorder could control someone that much. I was telling him: you just needed to stop overthinking that people will hurt you, remind yourself there’s no reason to be afraid, and call it a day. Yes, I was ignorant. I tried to convince him to change something he couldn’t change, to “overcome it,” as if these were only voices in his head.\nIn 2022, I joined the University of Khartoum. I enjoyed the first few weeks before I flew out of the country and returned only for the first semester exam. like any freshman, I spent that first year in exploration, even though I was mostly abroad and only came back for exams and a few short periods.I was just given access to all sorts of materials. I just got good at googling things, MIT lectures, practical sessions, philosophy, logic, debates, activities. I wasn’t extreme/insane compared to people who signed up for every program and consumed whatever their eyes landed on, but I was selectively adding to my curiosity bucket, which happened to be very large. At that time, I was a firm believer in “having the skills” rather than just scanning books, which of course didn’t make me a healthy intellectual out of me, not the kind with good habits and healthy shape. No, it did quite the opposite. It put my health at risk.\nI had early signs that something bad was about to happen. I even mentioned this to my friend Kenyata , telling him how much I lack entertainment and simple enjoyment in my life. I was in Morocco at the time, I told him that when I return back to Sudan, I wanted to explore life a bit, pause from the grind, and see what people did outside academics and work. I told him I planned to try different restaurants. And honestly the reason I wanted to have a pause was that, my brother had been asking about my social life. He somehow convinced me it was important for my health to go outside, socialize and meet some friends. I took his advice seriously because he’s an introvert like me, and I hoped that piece of wisdom came from his own experience. But when I came back, I overloaded myself with even more tasks. I consumed even more material, aggressively. The social promise I made to my brother vanished, and I completely forgot the need to entertain myself.\nI remember that day clearly, the night before was long I spend the whole night awake and went into the exam without any rest, it was a calculus exam so you can imagine the amount of preparation I needed to put. after the exam, I went to the Computer Science department building at the faculty (the one basically colonized by IT students) for a reason I can’t even remember. I was somewhere in the middle of the first staircase. and without any premises I felt I was dying.\nI experienced a tunnel vision , I felt I was isolated from the world, My heart started beating so fast for no reason, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel normal at all. I was shocked to the point I could barely breath, I was lucky that the stairs had a handrail I can hold onto, I slowly made my way to the building\u0026rsquo;s entrance, where some seniors noticed there is something wrong with me, I\u0026rsquo;ve asked them to bring me water and mango juice (Maza) for some reason, maybe I thought it was a sugar problem. I was carried to what I think was the network admins office or something similar where I rested but my heart couldn\u0026rsquo;t slow down. Thankfully a girl from my batch called Esraa saw me and stood stayed with me stood by since,\nI was taken to the hospital, where they put all those sensors to my chest and ran different scans and tests. After about half an hour of that relentless, heavy heartbeat, my heart finally slowed down. I expected nothing less than a stroke or some kind of heart condition. I even had this dramatic thoughts that I might die from heartbreak for reasons I had woven in my head. I thought, This must be it.\nSurprisingly, all the scans were clean. I remember the doctor telling me my heart was “like a horse’s heart,” and that I didn’t have any heart disease. Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the horse\u0026rsquo;s heart analogy I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less, but It was a relief, although I was too mentally overwhelmed to process anything. I never followed up with the doctors to understand exactly what happened. My family arrived and took me home. My sister Zeinab, who is a doctor, told me it was a panic attack and explained what that meant. I watched some videos about it including this TEDx video I remember clearly, and I immediately related to it. I also joined online support groups and found comfort in hearing other people’s stories.\nI was healing from this accident by listening to the stories of people who experienced the same thing. Knowing that others had gone through similar circumstances that I wasn’t alone was reasonable to me to relief. But I never looked into why I was triggered in the first other than knowing “stress can lead you here, and it will reoccur when you trigger it again.”\nI eventually noticed a pattern: I felt discomfort whenever I was at the university. I remember this day very distinctly where I wanted any excuse not to go there. And luckily for me, the car I used to drive had almost no gas, and I wasn’t planning to stand in a long fuel queue. For but for some reason, though, I decided to go using public transportation, first a city train, then a bus. While crossing the bridge, Kobry Alhadeed, I started getting anxious. I felt afraid. And the closer I got to the university, the more scared I became. I can’t remember the lectures from that day, but it was the day I confirmed the pattern.\nWhat shocked me was what happened after the lectures. A friend told me he wanted to pick something up from the Computer Science department building and asked me to walk with him before we return back home.I found myself standing in front of the entrance, and my stress levels were extreme. I couldn’t enter the building. That’s when I knew: this was the thing I feared. I was afraid that if I entered that building again, something would happen to me.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the building is officially the “CS Department,” but it’s mostly used for IT lectures. Since I’m a computer science student, I was never required to be there, I had no courses inside that building. But I used to go there anyway because many of our friends had lectures there and were always hanging out. What I didn’t realize is that I had been avoiding it the entire time without noticing. I didn’t enter that building again until the course finished.\nWriting this now triggered me a bit. It seems that building really freak me out the most. While I was fighting these internal battles with panic attacks, the symptoms started to manifest as IBS. I thought it was genetic, most of my family has it, but my sister told me mine was caused by stress, and because you were very stressed recently, the IBS decided to accompany you. And she was right, the conversations I had with Kenyata about pausing the grind, was because a very subtle, inner voice was whispering to me, you need to take rest, but because I was exploring and the dopamine was always high, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t notice that I was under stress, stress that I love doing, stress out of things I loved, I later learned that even the things you love can make you sick, but it was too late. I noticed I only experienced the symptoms when I was stressed, not when I ate garbage food.\nDuring that period, a sudden shift hit my social life, it changed suddenly. I couldn’t hold conversations longer than a minute. I avoided people, especially the ones I knew well. I felt that if I talked too much, I would die. And I mean that literally, that’s how it felt. Talking to people I knew became the scariest thing ever. Almost everyone in my batch noticed. “Ahmed has changed.” Some even sat with me and asked what was going on. I’m not sure what I told them, but I’m sure I said something like, “everything is fine”, because I had no words to describe what I was going through.\nAnd suddenly, I had social anxiety. Me? Ahmed? the guy who initiated our batch group chat, who was nominated to be the batch representative, who used to be public and comfortable speaking. I wasn’t afraid of people. And now I had social anxiety? It was hard to believe. It was a dramatic shift. My online friend the one I used to make fun of when he told me he had social anxiety, I was slowly beginning to understand him, and to understand how ignorant I had been. I never imagined a day would come when my thoughts would no longer control my body.\nI was skeptical. I made several assumptions to explain what I was experiencing. The first was returning to the idea that I actually had a heart disease, because all the discomfort was happening in my chest and around my heart. The second was that I might be bewitched or cursed somehow. And the third was that it was a punishment from God, because I had once thought my friend was exaggerating his condition, and making things up. Between those assumptions, I was lost. I genuinely didn’t know what was happening to me.\nA new fear was unlocked during that time. where I went to picnic and I met some friends some of them for the first time, it is common in Sudan, we greeted each other with hugs, before handshakes. I remember seeing the first group of friends, and before we even hugged, my body was signaling that I should run, that I shouldn’t let anyone touch me. I\u0026rsquo;m someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like physical interactions, but not to the point of being terrified of it. I didn’t want this. I forced myself to hug them “normally”, and of course I didn’t die, but my stress levels was even higher than when I stood in front of the CS department building. At that moment, I believed for sure that I was bewitched. There was no way, that someone can get stressed and feel like they might die from hugging a friend, someone I should have been happy to see.\nAfter about two hours, another group of friends arrived, and when it came time for the hugging thing again, I partially fainted and fell to the ground. My friend Mustafa sensed my heartbeat; it was beating to the max. I don’t remember the exact dialogue, but they gave me something to drink and eat. And then I was fine again. They were confused because my explanations weren\u0026rsquo;t clear; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear to me either.\nI don’t remember a lot from that period because too many things were happening at once. But I do remember that after that picnic, I stopped meeting people entirely. I skipped university for several days. And it wasn’t long after that when the war started. To this day, I still can’t fully understand why all of this happened. But at least I evaluated my assumptions: I have came to the realization I wasn’t bewitched. After about eight months, I went back to working out and running, and being able to do those things easily, without any heart issues, boosted my confidence that I didn’t have a heart disease.\nI was gradually disappearing from people\u0026rsquo;s life, I had no motivation to talk to people, I have more things that are telling me not to connect with people, I mean if just hugs are doing this to do. lol, Looking back, I see many people who have no explanation for why I disappeared from their lives, why my behavior changed so drastically. Things weren’t good even before the war they were getting worse, but at least they eventually led me to understand that stress was the cause, even when I couldn’t feel the stress itself. One of the strange, almost funny stories from that time: several weeks after the incident, the right side of my face became completely paralyzed. I couldn’t move it at all. I went to the hospital, they diagnosed me with Bell’s palsy , a condition where the facial nerve on one side of the face suddenly stops working. And of course I was bewitched, of all the diseases that I know, I was given a weird paralysis in the face, someone must have wanted to torture me. After reading more about it, I learned that stress can also cause it. I rested my heart by saying, Stress is the cause.\nI remember I landed an internship but only went onsite for a total of three days. I remember barely speaking to my best friends during that entire period. I don’t remember much about how things were at home either, but I’m sure I kept myself constantly busy. Those days affected almost every part of my life. I tend to have a weaker memory for the bad times, but what I’ve written here are the extremes, the moments I simply couldn’t forget. The belief that I always had control over my mind and my body, that I can act as a commander was a heaven that I only realized when I lost control, when my mind and body turned against me. I was afraid that people would see me as vulnerable, I was afraid that with all this stress adding more and more complexity to my life, that I would be dependent on someone, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be burden. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to know that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ok.\n","title":"Days That I Don’t Understand","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/days_that_i_didnt_understand/"},{"content":"The velocity at which I\u0026rsquo;m updating my beliefs about the world has never been known to be slow; saying \u0026ldquo;Oops\u0026rdquo; and updating my beliefs implies updating my behavior if needed.

I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.\nSean, Good Will Hunting (Park Bench Scene)\nAlthough my previous blog post was expected to be an explanation of what I assumed to be something I adopted a long time ago and never updated before:\nbut I have never revised the list since a while\nAdding new friends system I never expected the system to be perfect, or that I was doing what is ultimately right. The reason why I felt I should be listing this legacy system of adding new friends by writing the blog post , is because I felt it was the time to rethink it. I wasn’t explicit about this, (meaning it took me time to realize that I really need to rethink it.), but I felt this shouldn’t continue. The case analysis is not as good as it used to be in helping classifying people, many cases violated the rules, but the system still pulls me back to use its methods. [!IMPORTANT] I will be using the terms system and legacy system interchangeably. The term legacy system refers to an outdated but still functional computer system, software, or hardware that continues to be used because it performs its original, essential tasks, even as newer technologies emerge.\n[!NOTE] I deliberately selected the term value when saying assigning the name “Friend”, because it is not just a word, I consider it a value. Calling you a friend adds the values that require me to “allow myself to fall, to invest my emotions.”\nby this elboration I hope to clear the misconceptions that might accure from my previous writing, it build on top of the previous blog post Adding new friends system , you might want to take a look if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. this conversation will particularly discuss the cases where the system is not good enough, why I was still using it?, how it is so bad to the people who should be friends.\nWhy so many rules? Life is meant to be simple. There are many levels to look into why I don’t actually find it hard to rank people.one is Checklist based thinking happens everywhere, by everyone. First impressions are a sort of ranking system, and most people don’t take any effort in check listing their candidates, because it happens in the background of their minds, embedded just like first impressions.\nThe same happens to me, except that I might be using more rigorous tests. So I’m not really adding logic to the equation of life, it’s already there.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m not really walking around ranking people according to my checklist of what I favor, it is my mind that blocks me from transcending a relationship beyond what it is, unless it satisfies what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. this can act as a reason for why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so urgent about changing it, because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really suffering from it, it is something that happens almost naturally.\nAll the cool friends I could’ve made When establishing relationships, it is almost always the case that I don\u0026rsquo;t assign the value friend to them easily, lets call these people \u0026ldquo;candidates\u0026rdquo;, The best scenario is to have candidates who don’t care whether I gave this title to them or not; they don’t even ask about it. They see that I’m doing my best to match their energy.\nbut you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should\nAdding new friends system We’re supposed to enjoy the relationship without hindrance. I would do a great job at this, they would know I’m someone who never minds spending quality time with them, that I respect them, and am always happy to see them. Until they start to investigate their role within me too early.\nAnd if this happens, they won’t like it. They’ll translate me not adding them to the “friends” list as being heartless, as though they’re the ones taking part in the relationship, not me.\nI’d love if the universe worked according to my rules: why care about titles when I’m already there for you? But in the end, it’s not their fault. I shouldn’t have adopted this system in the first place, let alone explaining its creepiness to people or expecting them to understand it.\nHandling the misconceptions about “I will magically force myself to never invest emotions in the relationship” will take part shortly in this post, but for now, remember that the legacy system seemed to work for what I wanted it to do.\nhowever it does a greater job preventing “bad friends“. It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends) and this is where it helps me the most.\nAdding new friends system As long as it helps me make friends, and provides the definitions and rules of human interaction to me, I have no problem using it. But the real question is: why am I still using this legacy system?\nElaborating on the effects but there are downsides you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself.\nAdding new friends system Yes, I control the amount of love I stream toward someone/candidate, even if they were perfect candidates. I won’t send them any signals that strengthen our bond. I’ll avoid them. I’ll do what it takes to not invest emotion, and I’m good at it.\nI only stream what I think is sufficient to match their energy. The real downside is when this loop continues. They feel the walls I’m building hindering the relationship, and at that particular point I get disturbed.\nAt this stage, the best scenario is to respect the walls and plan to tear them down over time (though sometimes they’re never meant to be broken).\n1. Leakage in the system. In theory, I get to decide that I will not invest emotions, by controlling the amount of lets say love I stream for someone (love implies trust), just as computational theories ignore practical constraints, but in practice, emotions are not precisely controlled; they leak easily\n2. a double-edged sword. it is very common that I lose potential good friends in the process, and that hurts, seeing cool people leave. they realize how hard it is to deal with me, and then stop trying.\nThis cycle of people showing genuine interest in me, then suddenly losing it, is hard. It happened when I wasn’t aware that I had so many walls, that people aren’t good at climbing them. I was ignorant, selfish, not giving guidance on how to approach me.\nThinking it’s your thing to figure me out, who did I think I was? King Richard the Fifth? May I never trust my judgment again.\n3. But I\u0026rsquo;m hurt 2. What once felt unbearable to remember now feels necessary to recall. This one almost slipped out of memory, but when I lost those potential cool “friends,” I wasn’t happy about it. I remember now that I didn’t like it at all.\nI felt destined to live alone, not knowing I was drowning by my own design. I was too young to realize this. And instead of revising the list of rules I set to add new friends, to make them less rigorous, I fed it even more.\nWhy the legacy system is still in production Besides the system doing its job, there were boosters that helped keep it running.\nLet go before they let go:\nThe cycle of people entering and leaving my life left a scar. I started letting go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself caused these bad experiences to accumulate. It taught me that people leave, so I began preemptively leaving first.\n“People will stop trying to know you, you piece of shit. You’re setting the walls so high they won’t even try to climb them.” telling myself. And I had no idea that it was me causing this. That’s how two insecurities start boosting each other.\nThe legacy system is not helping me establishing new friendships (pending status cases). People are letting go of me because of this embedded legacy system. I let go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself helps me in the process of letting go of the people The legacy system says \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re anxious that they might leave you. I can help you to get rid of them preemptively.\u0026rdquo; The system rewards me by \u0026ldquo;either way, they might have been bad friends or they didn\u0026rsquo;t pass the tests\u0026rdquo;. man screw the tests.\nin short this monster was feeding itself. and apparently me.\nIrresistible features:\nMy sister once made an observation during a family discussion about our dark past selves. She noticed that growing up (me), I had access to the bad world, with tons of potential bad friends I could’ve made, but I chose not to.\nThe system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, actual true negatives, the ones that really would’ve hurt me. The problem is, it also keeps making false positives: rejecting people who were good, who could’ve stayed. It convinces me that losing them was just self protection,Though it’s hard to take the burden of \u0026ldquo;controlling the stream of love towards someone\u0026rdquo;, it’s also hard to be stabbed in the back. The system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, There was no other way, it was either being armed with it or being naïve and cut by friends.\nI’m good at keeping myself busy:\nThe legacy system not only controls how much love I give to people, it controls how many people I give it to.\nThose I call friends rarely exceed five or ten. I keep myself busy, which limits how many interactions I can manage. I’ve learned I don’t need to make a friend in every new country or city I live in, not doing so doesn’t kill me.\nI manage the few friends I have very well. They give me more than enough. I don’t plan to have many friends, it’s not aligned with my social energy or resources. The legacy system is good at controlling that number. It’s a win-win.\nAnswers not found elsewhere:\nSometimes I think about dismantling the system and moving on, but questions arise:\nHow do I prevent wounds if I step outside my walls?\nHow do I define friendship as something prestigious and not instantly given?\nThe first fence in the system is crucial, it helps control the number of people in my life. I can’t be friends with everyone I meet; I’d end up with too many.\nQuestions the legacy system fails to answer Some questions the system simply can’t answer well:\nWhat should I do if they figure it out?\nPeople go through painful ups and downs during the “pending” phase. They lose meaning in establishing a relationship once they realize they’re not assigned a value yet.\nI wasn’t trained to trust people this fast, but it’s not right to keep them hanging. The system doesn’t guide me here: should I explain it? Should I force myself to love them or assign the value they deserve?\nWhat should I do with pending requests?\nSome people are never meant to enter, I prefer keeping walls between us. The system doesn’t provide guidance.\nI remember a friend, culturally a friend, but I never really invested in him. He was great, but I didn’t want to allow myself to fall into that bond. Poor him, what did he have to do with my hormones? Again, the system didn’t help.\n404 Not Found:\nSometimes I fail to migrate relationships outside the scope of the greater good , that shared purpose that once connected us.\nI meet cool people in cool places; we like each other. But once the shared context is gone, I can’t find a new reason to stay connected.\nOutside the greater good:\nSome people are great under the scope of a project or purpose, but outside it, I can’t find what links us. Their attempts get pended.\nUndefined “something”:\nothertimes its more specific cases, For example, someone once part of my team, ideally female, wanted to get to know me outside of that shared goal. “Female friend”? I have no definition for that. How should I act? I don’t know, but I’ll definitely run away from anything undefined, lol.\nIf this isn’t your case, good for you. Some people don’t suffer from basic questions like deciding whether to make someone a friend or not. But I do, not enough to urgently change, but enough to notice it.\nI can still approach people, create one sided friendships, get what I need, make them smile, make them do what I want gently, wish them well, and support their wins.\nMost importantly, I can keep myself busy enough to avoid looking too closely at my malfunctioning legacy system.\ntoday! I’ve unlocked a hidden insecurity that’s been operating subconsciously, one I partly knew existed but never realized how much it was feeding other insecurities.\nThis moment of self-awareness feels like progress. I just need to unlearn it now. It might take years, but I’ve begun.\n","title":"Elaborate: Adding New Friends System","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"I get asked:\nHow do you deal with ordinary people? The ones that don\u0026rsquo;t bother you? and when does it start that they enter your life?\nThis question has got me thinking. I recalled that checklist (set of rules) I have for making new friends, but I have never revised the list for a while. I have seen cases where people just hack the system, and suddenly they are knocking on the door of my heart before even check-listing half of it.\nThe set of rules I have adapted is simple enough to help me make new friends; however, it does a greater job preventing “bad friends.” It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends), and this is where it helps me the most. More about it later; first, let’s get to see where this starts.\nIn elementary school, I made the observation that most people around me complain about how they were betrayed, stabbed in the back, or any sort of resentment that happened to them, caused by relationships, particularly friendships. To make sense of why they suffer, my observation was: “All these people you were hurt by, you had positive feelings about them; you loved them.\u0026quot; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be in such a position, so I learned through preaching to myself.\nthe equation was obvious to me: \u0026ldquo;the more emotions I invest in someone, the deeper the wound is,\u0026rdquo; and you start investing emotions in people the moment you assign them the name \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; in your head. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall this equation resulting in me being afraid of making friendships, but what I did was to learn from them. What I learned is that many cases were wounded because they were too early in assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the people they met.\nAs social creatures, we tend to make friendships in the new places or paths we take (new school, new university, new habit…) or sometimes when we feel lonely, or even worse, when we are too optimistic. However, these reasons do not respect the slow pace needed for making friendships; they are in a rush. For example, a fresher might feel either very overwhelmed by the number of questions they got, so they try to establish friendships (either to feel no guilt if people also turn out not to have answers, or to have answers), or very energized by the amount of sudden freedom they were never granted before, and they want to make friends to do all sorts of crazy things they want to do. So whether your reasons were noble (work on study groups, research, projects, politics) or less impactful (host parties, go to the park), they are all tagged with urgency. Of course, you can\u0026rsquo;t wait two years to make a friend.\nFor these very reasons, \u0026ldquo;bad friends\u0026rdquo; happen, that we needed to call someone a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; we had tons of emotions that couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold their horses and needed someone to run for.\nHow I planned to overcome this? Simply don\u0026rsquo;t call people your \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; I haven’t used that term for as long as I can remember. My very first friend, I was telling myself about \u0026ldquo;Wow, this guy has done so much for me. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to call him a friend, then I\u0026rsquo;m selfish and heartless\u0026rdquo;. What people don\u0026rsquo;t understand is that I still had a quality time with that guy without calling him a friend. I was enjoying my life with them, and I was making memories.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve applied what happened with the first person I ever admitted by heart as a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the friends I met down the road, is to never call them friends until time passes and they prove they are trustworthy.\nIf you keep saying everyone is your friend, you will end up wounded alot.\nBut there are downsides, you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you are going to be in defense mode all the time (or it is not that bad; maybe you will get used to it), but you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should. But don\u0026rsquo;t call them friends, not yet, because the moment you start assigning them the value \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; you allow yourself to invest more emotions (trust, love, loyalty…). If you have an argument saying friendship should not be that hard, and at the start I don\u0026rsquo;t really allow myself to fall completely, then this is good for you, but for me, no. Assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to people means a lot more, so I don\u0026rsquo;t give it away that easily. Luckily, society gave us names as placeholders for people that even can help define the interactions and limits of relationships to have with people: there are Coworkers, Neighbors, Classmates, Colleagues, Managers, Team members, Collaborators, Customers, Clients, Students, Teachers, and even Mutuals (your friend\u0026rsquo;s friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be your friend). Why don\u0026rsquo;t people use these? They are good, they protect you, they help you.\nGoing back to our discussion, the reason why I want to revise my set of rules for making new friends as mentioned before is that there seem to be people who violate the rules. They are just cool enough to make friendships with; they can\u0026rsquo;t stay just \u0026ldquo;people,\u0026rdquo; they need to be \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; And they already have the same amount of admiration as my friends, but I\u0026rsquo;m yet to call them \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; This nonsense happens for a lot of reasons; let\u0026rsquo;s list some:\nThe experiences I went through in making friends were very long in terms of duration, and this is purely by chance. My very first friends took a long time to call them friends — years. This was reflected in some way in my subsequent experiences (I started to consider taking more time just as how my first friendships took more time to bond). This might be nonsense, but that means even if someone passed the checklist in under six months, and they were finally qualified to be \u0026ldquo;friends,\u0026rdquo; without a year or two passing by, I can\u0026rsquo;t call them friends.\nIn simple terms, the way I formed friendship was that I get to know people very slowly and we disappear for years in the middle. This reflected that I don\u0026rsquo;t make people friends easily.\nAnother reason is to be mindful of the greater good we are serving. This is very common in relationships of University and Work because there is often a greater purpose that must be served and is compromised the moment we call ourselves \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; A good example would be a woman called Samar Yahia. Samar ages me by about ten years. We were co-founders of a startup at some point, and we just met. I never knew who she was, she knew who I am, and we never met to this very day although we live in the same city. Why? Simply because we prioritize the greater good of the startup by being co-founders/co-workers. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a great time; we had amazing conversations, laughter, we shared experiences and life lessons, we allowed ourselves to enjoy the process, and never made it boring. But let\u0026rsquo;s just not take it to the next level of being friends even if it feels right. If I ever get the chance to meet Samar in an alternative world, we would have been great friends, or if we had something other than work.\nThe last one is that I want to protect either myself or someone by not going to be a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; and it is better to have walls between. An example would be: Ahmed is a cool new freshman at the university, and I want to take him under my wings by making friendship with him, aka investing emotions. But I might not do that. Although he passed the checklist and is now a good candidate, I might prefer to keep the default relationship (colleague) assigned to him. Why? Well, since he is too young, I’m not sure if by this sudden access to all sorts of amusement and ideologies, he will remain the one I hoped to make friendship with. This way I can protect myself from making friendships with Ahmed. Another pattern that happens a lot, is the other way around: University colleagues try to get to know me outside the University, and they are often pushed by walls I build to protect them from me. I don’t want them to invest their emotions in me because I don’t see myself as trustworthy, that I\u0026rsquo;m not someone they can really rely on, and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust myself to handle that responsibility, at least not yet. This way, I protect them (and many times hurt them) using the walls I build and keeping them away from my friends zone, and most importantly, keep myself away from their friends zone.\nAt the end, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just a traumatized kid formalizing all these rules to make friendship. In reality, I don\u0026rsquo;t really suffer from this. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m good at reaching out to people and making friendships. I don\u0026rsquo;t struggle to communicate with people or get what I want. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a bad time searching for quality time. And thinking about how much worse it could be without these rules, I remind myself to be grateful.\nWhat kind of walls do you mean exactly?\nThe first one, I assume, is to act ordinary (which is a product of the walls but it\u0026rsquo;s just the first fence), acting ordinary is to not reveal the basic information about me, my name, my age, what I do in life. But this layer is fragile, once I\u0026rsquo;m asked, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind answering, it helps me save time and avoid making unnecessary relationships, I can\u0026rsquo;t count the amount of cool and bad people I could have made in life if I had never had this first wall which I now call the fence (it assumes acting dumb while knowing, being nonchalant while I\u0026rsquo;m a bit interested(this one started to fading recently I gotta get my shit together), sharing misguided information about me).\nThe most important wall is the privacy wall. I only allow a certain amount of information to get leaked from what I\u0026rsquo;m doing in my life. What I want to do. I\u0026rsquo;m not giving or sharing what violates my privacy. this includes (my family, my moves, my trips, my quality time, my free time, my friends, my performance, my upside-downs)\nless in height, subtle insecurities I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to involve people in.\n","title":"Adding new friends system","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"To nerd out and talk about a particular topic that you are deeply interested in/ obsessed with, requires you to unveil part of yourself. Your personality, your affection, your love for that topic. Often, it feels like dancing in the symphony of that subject(my analogy is very consumed, but I feel it holds true here).\nWhile jumping between discussions on Substack , I found myself watching this Kurt Vonnegut lecture.\nWatch the lecture Although I enjoyed the whole presentation, I was most impressed by his performance in the final minutes, the way he left the stage, his funny moves and gestures. This wasn’t unique to the ending, though. The way he spoke and carried himself throughout the lecture was “unique.”\nUnique to him.\nIt felt like this was how his soul interpreted information or felt about it, how it reacted to the joy of sharing his inner reasoning and experiences. You could sense the years of thought and accumulation behind every word. The jokes, the gestures, the rhythm, they were all expressions of his love for what he was saying.\nI found myself imagining a kind of paradise around the idea that he was never ashamed of being himself. Because when you look at him, he was doing weird stuff, awkward moves, overly specific jokes, yet the audience loved it. They understood and accepted his (uniqueness soon will be called awkwardness). They even craved it.\nuniqueness is just him being true to himself, acting natural and manifesting what he feels in the way he likes\nif this uniqueness exists in an alternative world, a world where he couldn’t be himself freely, where his natural self would be judged as strange akward. where his uniqueness is akwardness.\nWatching him leave the stage while everyone clapped, appreciating what he had shared, reminded me of how many intellectuals from my country travel abroad to pursue their careers in the United States or other Western nations that seem to value what they can offer.\noften saying,\nMy skills were welcomed in the country of Uncle Sam.\nThis isn’t about how the United States has built the perfect habitats for nerds and anyone who wants to be themselves; by embracing people as they are and shaping social norms around tolerance, rather than judgment.\nIt’s more about how bad I feel coming from regions where being your true self is misunderstood, misused, and simpy is a crime.\nAt that particular moment, watching him leave the stage, I remembered how unlucky we are for not growing up in environments that encourage us to nerd out, to share the things we are obsessed with in our own way, or even to share them at all.\nYou don’t know how many times I’ve tried to have deep discussions with people who are truly good at something(they are nerds about particular subject), just to crack through their insecurities and show them:\n“I’m a good listener. I won’t judge. Only love. I won’t be freaked out by your awkwardness. I’m more interested in hearing you express your passion naturally, not formally or shyly. You know you’re obsessed with it deep down — and there’s no reason to feel guilty about that with me.”\nCracking those defense walls is never easy.\nAnd it’s not their fault.\nIt’s the world they were born into, one that never prioritized who they truly are.\n","title":"Where You Are Allowed To Be You","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/where_you_are_allowed_to_be_you/"},{"content":"When making decisions in life, especially when we are faced with selecting between two events, we find ourselves comparing how important they are in order to determine which event we should choose. Some people study the implications of each decision and measure how rewarding or penalizing the outcomes might be. Picking the least penalty is a tactic for choosing a decision under this scenario.\nI first encountered this three years ago in one of Jeff Bezos’s interviews. he called it the Regret Minimization Framework. This tactic can be used on a smaller scale, even in daily decisions like getting out of bed or not. I’m sure you’ve used this tactic today in your own decision making process as a kind of mental tool. Usually, it helps me clarify priorities and take action with confidence. But what I’m here to share is a funny story: for the very first time, I was unable to use this utility in my decision making process.\nTwo events were taking place in the same hour block the next morning (8:00 AM). To make a decision, I defaulted my brain to use the regret minimization method. Unfortunately, the two events were equally likely in their consequences, at least from what my mind could list. Of course, life can have consequences that shows the advantages of one selection over the another, but I’m yet to know this and I need to make decisions under what I only know, and able to consider at the particular time I’m given this.\nIt felt exactly like how mathematical reasoning falls apart when dividing by zero, or how classical physics fails to explain things at small scales. This dilemma, of having two equally important events with either equally likely outcomes or vague consequences, made the regret minimization method fail completely. And honestly, that was a funny realization, because I’m rarely hesitant in making decisions. I know exactly what if I want to make a decision over another.\nMaybe I expected too much from this method,or misused it,but that’s not really the point I want to highlight. Perhaps this reflection doesn’t offer a grand piece of wisdom, but you can still take something from it: explore new ways of making decisions in your own life. Experiment with frameworks or tactics that help you choose the optimal option more often. And most importantly, pick an option, don’t stay up until (3:42 AM) like me, still undecided and unable to sleep.\n","title":"The Limits of the Regret Minimization Framework","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_limits_of_the_regret_minimization_framework/"},{"content":" Everyone is atheist until the plane starts falling. I have no clue who said this.\nThe numerous different stories that act as catalysts for returning to God and thinking about the existence of a grand designer or creator, shared by people across the globe, are interesting. There are a variety of patterns, and often the most interesting ones are those concluded through epistemic rationality rather than convenience or bias—where there was evidence that God existed, for them. One pattern is how God existed in everyday life. A good example is the historical belief that the creation of all temples and religions around the world throughout history is an innate, lowkey, subtle need for God.\nAnd this is what I’m interested in pulling strings from and building upon—what I felt right before I sleep. I’m not diving into theology, but rather sharing a concept I just coined: “Gratitude Register.” This is what I assume as the “where I find God” in my “everyday life pattern.” No matter what beliefs I’m holding or how religious or spiritual I am at a particular point in time, at the end of the day (literally) I find myself accounting for what was good today and in my life. This happens by default; it’s the way your psyche validates the day, your memory works, and you yourself try to make sense of all the nonsense you were doing throughout the day. Depending on how I define good (which of course includes biased beliefs or definitions from religion), I can bring different combinations of them. Now, if these things outweigh the misfortunes I have, that means it is a good day (again, there is no agreed upon way of defining and measuring misfortunes). Hence, some positive feelings may start to appear—one that stands out so loudly is gratitude. This feeling is a well known visitor, outshining others through its powerful urge.\nGratitude: “I’m here.” Translation: I’m grateful. Gratitude: “I need to make a decision so fast (urge).” Translation: I need to be grateful “for someone.”\nTranslation is what the mind tells about the chemicals.\nThis urge—and the small space I get to make the decision to fill it with someone—is what makes gratitude such a special “positive feeling.” This is how I translate it as a way to know God, and I’m feeling it every day. To know this Gratitude Register (just like how a CPU register is filled quickly and needs to assign the value to some process) requires some form of mental allocation.\nIf it happens and if I’m a full time atheist (I don’t wish that for anyone) I believe this interaction, of validating my day and unconsciously inviting “gratitude” as a result of just being human, shall rescue me from muddle and may guide me toward the light.\nThis is a piece of my honest and truthful analysis of my feelings toward gratitude.\n","title":"Gratitude Register","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/gratitude_register/"},{"content":" do things badly\nAs the years pass by, I find myself adapting to different reasons to keep living, and to share, I\u0026rsquo;m not as clear as I used to be about why I should be posting something publicly, but looking back over the years, I recall how writing started. How reasons changed.\nThe Seeds of Writing I\u0026rsquo;ve had amazing language teachers (Tahia and Jamal), who encouraged me to write and read since I was a little I\u0026rsquo;ve been under the wings of people who are naturally good at writing (this probably influenced me, I mean, I used to write poetry when I was a little) I felt the need to express my feelings through writing (I\u0026rsquo;ve been actively journaling since 8th grade) I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen in love with quotes and I became a collector at some point, they seemed to explain the world, so I started crafting my own through writing (High school/teenager period) I\u0026rsquo;ve wished people could write more about their experiences and not generic content When I needed someone to talk about Computer Science from their heart, experience, and not what they have studied Reem\u0026rsquo;s blog was my savior, and then later I loved the writings of Mohammed Yousif especially the self-reflection notes, and his feelings. I wanted to document my journey in life, I wished that the elderly people in my life had books/blogs that they had left behind for me, so I can get to know them more, even after they\u0026rsquo;re gone. I wanted to make sense of my doings, I would write the task I should be doing for myself to see if I understand the procedure that is supposed to happen, and if there are any subtle pitfalls in my understanding I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of. Yes, these are all different reasons, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how I\u0026rsquo;m going to organize them, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to overthink this.\nDemons but I got demons\u0026hellip;. that were holding me from writing.\nI get amazed by the number of clicks I write on the keyboard everyday writing something. and it is really fascinating how I barely share it publicly. I\u0026rsquo;m not in my best to recall the WHY behind why I\u0026rsquo;ve been skeptical about this, but below are what I can list now:\nBeing busy is the biggest factor for not sharing it publicly, not that I can\u0026rsquo;t press post/publish but that I have a cognitive overload from being busy, I get to experience and learn lesson on the fly which I assume its a bless. but it comes in huge numbers and sometimes hard to unpack what I\u0026rsquo;ve learn. so they time between me taking the lesson and preparing to share the lesson spans, if I assigned a name to this period, lets say C, there will even more lessons that will pop in that period which lead to me giving up completely on sharing.\nNot making sense of how this would help me. there was a time where I\u0026rsquo;ve had lost the meaning and I was blinded by something that I don\u0026rsquo;t know, the prevented me from seeing how this can help me in any way (practically speaking, yes I had reasons to write but not to share)? (later I found some reasons to share).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the writing tools: at that age being afraid is the default, I was telling myself if that x human is better than you at writing and knows how why would you still share? they got the experience, they got the talent, the got the time, they got the confidence. looking to back to how small I was to start such a thing makes sense.\nDo people call it a comfort zone?: I recall in 2023-2025 I stopped a number of my social media accounts repeatedly, until this very day, I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet posted one single status on my main WhatsApp account. And months can pass without sharing something publicly, now this has its own story, but it was one big reason that I\u0026rsquo;ve felt comfort in not being in public/ in not sharing, even if that is on social media.\nPrioritize what\u0026rsquo;s important: there is also a time when I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at the words that I\u0026rsquo;m writing, and that I should be sharing, but not to everyone, maybe I can do this to my closest people first, family, and friends. They deserve better, someone who is not being busy, but being responsive and collaborative. So throughout the last 2 years, I was investing more in my closest circle.\nDetails and setup: everyone has their own unique way of communicating, with mutual culture you get to say what you want smoothly (by smoothly I mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t face difficulties in deciding what to say and the recipient is not having trouble interpreting your words to what you actually meant) if we were to imagine how deviated I\u0026rsquo;m from that line, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not as close. maybe in reality I can relate and talk to people, but inside my head I overthink and over-engineer what I should say to the person in-front of me based on the data they are directly or indirectly steaming to me, will they relate to what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, are they comfortable talking about this, are they going to feel offended, am I talking fast, and not showing them the point, did I match their energy/slang, was the conversation interactive?, dozens of questions, now image you are talking to over thousand person, thats what I put in my mind and heart before sharing anything publicly. Now these details are hard to overcome.\nI\u0026rsquo;m wasting my time here: this is a real demon here, it tells me that the time I would spend in writing and then responding to people\u0026rsquo;s comments, inquiries, friendships, rituals out of curiosity about me from my posts, can be dedicated to doing something more useful, I would spend more time doing more important things maybe.\nmoving forward This blog website is an attempt; it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be the last one, but I have faith in it.#\n","title":"Why I’m Sharing Notes","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-do-this/"},{"content":" Early to rise early to bed, makes a man healthy but socially dead\nOne thing that i\u0026rsquo;m sure about is, that I don\u0026rsquo;t miss people easily, not that I don\u0026rsquo;t bare people, or I\u0026rsquo;m antisocial. but I keep myself busy to the point I forget about the people, I feel sorry for myself and for the people I know that I\u0026rsquo;m emotionally inactive when I need it.

And I have tales to tell, but hopefully, choosing the most significant one will find a wider audience and fit. I will talk in 3s three categories and 3 notes\nI will talk about What I learned about the world What I learned about the people What I learned about myself. I\u0026rsquo;m not very visionary and dreamy, so I think about life directly, but here are some lessons that I learned.\nWhat you learn models the way you think. We try as much as possible to interpret the complexity of the world and answer the why and how behind things; the way we think and use our minds is completely different based on what we have learned, and dictates how we will view the world. If that\u0026rsquo;s chemistry, you will look at life as a chemical reaction, a mathematician viewing it as a melody of logic, a writer as stories, and so on.\nThe reality has nothing to do with your hope. Life is very unpredictable; you can\u0026rsquo;t say good things happen for good people, or I have put too much into this project hence it will succeed, life has nothing to do with your hope.\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t pursue happiness directly. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall when was the last time I heard someone asking whether you are happy or not, and how to be happy. It looks like everyone is suddenly not talking about happiness, which is good in my opinion. Happiness is something you pursue indirectly.\nhere comes the people.

What I found is, besides having the potential to fit the need, if you have reached out, cold emailed, or any sort of communication, people will help you make things out.\nPeople have feelings, I guess. They feel, every single action you do influences the way they look at you. If you never show up for their invitations, if you were a bit off that day, your tune changed. I fooled myself for a long time, thinking that people would never notice the small things that I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\nAbout me.

For instance,, if I live in the big city of Khartoum with a 9 - 5 job anda regular pace of life, I will never be able to generalize what people might suffer from and what challenges they face in different parts of Sudan. I just can\u0026rsquo;t.\nKeeping up, what is that? I\u0026rsquo;m the worst when it comes to keeping up with people and the news. In order to feel natural and get along with most of today\u0026rsquo;s youth and even adults, you need to have a middle ground to talk about, in most cases, football, politics, and news, which I don\u0026rsquo;t really bother myself to follow. So this is one of the things I learned that I simply suck at bringing topics to the middle ground.\nAvoiding Regret I love video editing/storytelling, tho I\u0026rsquo;m not editing as much as I used to, but it\u0026rsquo;s still one of the things that I loved doing naturally and unconditionally. I never admit to saying it verbally, but the reason I\u0026rsquo;m making videos is to capture a snapshot of time, just like git versions the code. The main incentive behind doing this action. is to avoid regret. I can\u0026rsquo;t live with this burden in my chest. There are dozens of videos that I discarded, many of which I\u0026rsquo;ve never started. Tens of drafts have never seen the light, and a bit over 50 were sent privately to the once i trust the most. so my advice to you is.\n","title":"21","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/21/"},{"content":"Things I was wrong about Recently, I came to the realization: I’m not giving people what they deserve. I don’t make it easy for them to stay close to me, not only strangers, but even the people who care about me the most. I build walls, my mood is forever changing around them, and constantly not around. And I know this is wrong. I noticed that at the beginning of relationships, I can match people’s energy effortlessly, but over time I gradually drift back into being distant and cold. It feels unfair, it\u0026rsquo;s hypocrisy. either I shouldn’t appear friendly in the first place, or I should remain consistent with the way I start. which is being friendly forever.\nCRM when thinking about these problems, I found out I was not up to the promises I tell myself, although I want to check on people I love from time to time, I don\u0026rsquo;t do that, I just can\u0026rsquo;t maintain it, I fail every time, I recently came to the term, Customer Relation management where business people keep track of their customers, and found a video that talks about applying this idea into tracking your social life.\nWhen I thought about these problems, I realized I wasn’t living up to the promises I made to myself. Even though I want to check on the people I love from time to time, I just don’t do it. I just can’t maintain it; I fail every time. Recently, I came across the term Customer Relationship Management, where businesses keep track of their customers, and I found a video talking about applying the same idea to tracking your social life. where you keep track of customers and call when you, its just a system that companies use to remember their customers. I did my own version on Notion , where I listed names of people I care about the most, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too late until I forgot about it.

I’m not the best at making analogies, but I will tell the story of stochastic processes and my conversation with Zainab. She’s a Computer Science major who devoted more time and effort to mathematics while also maintaining good grades in CS related subjects. She shared me the work of a mathematician in stochastic processes after winning a Nobel prize on his word, or Fields Medal I really can’t recall it. we were arguing about how he managed to imagine these things, let alone architecting a framework to explain it, Although we tried to “wonder” but we come from completely different backgrounds, as I see stochastic processes from practical Machine Learning point of view, mainly thinking of “if I never set a random seed I might never reproduce my same results again, my weights will always initialize randomly, the gradient will always give different results/trough when minimizing the cost function”, Zainab is coming from a completely different background thinking about the mathematics how differential equations are implemented…etc.\nThis idea of things being as you imagine them, or as the image you are able to craft by generalizing from previous experiences, is something I often think about.\nHow to benefit from this lesson. Assuming you want to study a material in a new subject that you have never studied before, you will have generalization ability to predict how it\u0026rsquo;s going to be, but the reality might be different. and sure it is different, from the things that you can think of, it is always better to do the process to know how things are. quantum mechanics seems like you will be imagining where the cat is, what will happen if I observe it, but in reality, you will be doing differential equations, which will shape the framework of how you think about these problems. So this might let you think twice that THINGS ARE NOT AS YOU IMAGINE them, don’t let your assumptions fool you.\nInstead, it should be a part of your learning process, when you hit the realization of what actually this topic is talking about, for a very long time, I thought calculus is about calculation, after reading it I knew that it was talking about the rates of changing, and now I view as the art of dealing with tight spaces, and I will keep changing my assumption about it as I go, or maybe adding to the previous once. so having this flexibility will always help.\n","title":"What you want to major in might not be exactly what you imagine it to be","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/what_you_want_to_major_in_might_not_be_exactly_how_you_imagine_it/"},{"content":"Lately, I lost my ability to focus and maintain a flow state. I don’t sleep late, I eat relatively healthy food, and I’m not dopamine addicted. The problem comes down to practices that would align your efforts with what you want to achieve.\nToday, and after 15 days of nonsensical hard work (definitely I learned, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t comfortable learning), I get an hour with myself, having a lovely flow state, I will note and try to list all the things that I have done to get my focus back. 1. Sleeping early (70%) The percentage here indicates the importance of the action and how it contributes to the focus during the day, sleeping early isn’t new to me, I noticed that not doing this step, will degrade my performance (mentally \u0026amp; physically) particularly mentally, the physical condition can be refreshed after 1:00 PM or in the middle of the day, but the mentally is ever lasting throughout the day. But doing this step alone (i.e, validating how just sleeping early can affect your focus/performance) is not highly rewarding; it’s more of a prevention than a boost, which prevents you from having a bad day/focus rather than boosting you with flow state.\n1. Waking up early(90%) Now this is the most important part, sleeping early is not enough, you need its complement, which is waking up early, whether you slept at 9:00 PM or 12:00 AM\nWaking up early always makes it better to concentrate.\n","title":"Flow State and Sleep","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/flow_state_and_sleep/"},{"content":"I once read:\n“one of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know, someone in your class might find your presence inviting and warm even if you’ve exchanged a few words with them or maybe none at all, someone on the street loves your smile and it brightens their path for the next few blocks, someone who regularly comes to work is disappointed when you aren\u0026rsquo;t there, someone missed you today, someone noticed when you’re gone, someone loves you when you’re there, someone loves you when you’re nowhere to be found at all, you might think you have always disappeared when you’re no longer in the picture, but you never left the frame”\nAs far as I remember, this quote is the very reason I no longer question why people might feel my existence in their lives is adding value. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t project myself to if I were the “people”… do people help in my life indirectly, or without them knowing? Unlike my previous answers, which were showing independent personality and actions that didn’t need the “people” in their space. I found that sometimes people do change the way I think, talk, the frequency of doing something good, the latency of retrieving meaning from something, the hope and the discovery. Sometimes it’s crystal clear how I\u0026rsquo;m affected by their doings, other times it’s indirect; only their existence will bring every good part of me to life again.\nIt really sadness me that I was loved by many, more than I thought, I recently published a video, after a long time of me being distant, people went crazy sending to me and asking how I’m, and most of them notice that I was not around recently, I was fooling my mind that social life is not important, wether you are present or not, people will forget you, in short, it is hard to admit, but there are people out there who love us more that we know.\n","title":"The greatest tragedy in life","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_greatest_tragedy_in_life/"},{"content":"It was a rainy day when I realized that I was 19 years old, and I only had a few months left to turn 20. I’m no longer becoming a teenager, just like how John Green puts it, my 20s will go fast. My 30s will go faster than I can imagine, and suddenly I’m 40.\nYou can’t let your mind stop thinking about the future or let the things from the past stop controlling you. I have experienced life and responsibilities, but surely the 20s will be different, and I tried to answer one question: what am I afraid of? Why I’m afraid of being 20: and it turns out it is not only one question,but I was filled with lots of questions:\nWhat do I want to do for the rest of my life? What do I want to keep? What do I want to quit? Who will I stay with? Which people would I leave? Will I be able to practice my hobbies as the time I need to make videos and pursue my cinematography projects? What would happen to the way I think? Will my beliefs keep helping me? Will I remain a robust young dreamer or a dull mechanic worker in this fast world? Will I ever be able to never forget what I wanted to achieve? Will I be able to go through the mud as I entered the 20? Will the opportunities come? Will the things I love remain the same? Would I remain settled even after experiencing my 20s? Will I be able to interpret the complexity of the world and answer these questions, or just be the silent man who never ever thinks beyond his responsibilities? Or I will just ignore all the questions, and say in everything and every time there will be a crack, and it\u0026rsquo;s where the light gets in. And I should never create competitions and challenges that don’t exist yet. I’m sure Allah swt will guide me in every step, and just focus on what matters and eventually everything will come, and keep believing that all the things that I have lost will find their way to me. And it will come back to me. I’m turning 20 next week. Here are some lessons I think I learned in my teens, I may change my mind about some of them in the future.\nYour family must be no.1 priority in your life. You must have one thing that your life revolves around(Religion, category of people). People are not good at understanding themselves. Being Busy can prevent you from doing stupid things, and at the same time from good things, make sure to balance. Sleep early and wake up early. Don’t create competitions that doesn’t exist, be realistic. You can explore life in your teens and 20s and be a generalist, but set a limit for that and try to specialize and focus on the important parts. Routine is the small steps you take towards every big goal you set for yourself. A good level of understanding yourself, is knowing what you are not good at. If you’re a junior and you think you are smarter than an old outdated seniors, think twice; they have experience. Someone may find your presence warm and lovely without you knowing, so always be kind. If people do like you and you don’t know why, try to know why and keep practicing this thing for the rest of your life. Memories are the most warm feeling in the world, and the time you’re remembering them, will always be a happy time. I guess Happening is something that you pursue indirectly. Pray to Allah for giving you a clear mind, and practice exercise, eliminate distractions and you will have super flow state. Our beliefs are changing every time and we probably notice that late. If you ever felt happy for no reason try to ask yourself why? Write it down and read it when you’re down. Being optimistic about something and putting massive emotions into it doesn’t mean it will succeed. Reality is just independent of your thoughts Sad, or in pain? This will always come back at some point; you gotta use the time you have when you’re at your best. You may hurt people without knowing that you did, so you need to make sure you apologize frequently and ask people about how you behave. Chasing one thing will make the other things run away, like chasing a job but your health is in danger. You can be good at anything, including research and engineering, without a university, but the university is still important. We are not alike in the way we receive new information and knowledge; some know how to extract every possible information out of it, while others don’t. Mainstream titles like “entrepreneurship” can wait, and people who are seeking it since early ages of their career or uni want only the money, but they don’t have the needed skills and capacity to be the one. You may be good at using one of the technologies that uses scientific methods, but till you should always be humble to that outdated professor who spends his life solving equations and teaching math that you see as useless. You just didn’t realize the importance of it yet and the impact he is having. Avoid blaming your family members ","title":"20","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/20/"},{"content":"One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on Facebook , not consistently, and then I went through what I called “ Manulasis ”(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.\nThis happened because of the overwhelming number of times I discarded posts, notes, videos, or images I intended to share. Eventually, I gave up and abandoned the whole idea, and in doing so, I vanished from reality. This hesitation wasn’t new to me; I’ve been repeating this pattern since childhood. I would have sudden peaks of exposing my thoughts to the world, followed by long troughs of detachment and isolation. The amount of life that happens during those troughs makes it difficult to say everything when I finally try to reconnect with the world again.\nIf I turn a blind eye to the complexity, one of the strongest incentives behind sharing my notes is the fear of regret . I have been running from this feeling most of my life. The idea that all the messages, reflections, and thoughts I discarded will haunt me in the future terrifies me. This fear is closely tied to the feeling of standing on the Day of Judgment, knowing I had something that might help someone, but I never shared it. Recording what I’ve learned is a way to pass something forward to future generations.\n","title":"Why Im Sharing Notes - Regret","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-im-sharing-notes-regret/"},{"content":" There\u0026rsquo;s an anecdote about Richard Feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on Mr Feynman desk and makes a comment about these being a record of Feynman\u0026rsquo;s thinking and then Mr Feynman corrects the historian and says that: these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you\u0026rsquo;re thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that\u0026rsquo;s when Mr Feynman says: no they aren\u0026rsquo;t a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.\nIf I were to say the most important feature of making my life interpretable, it would be writing. I make sense of what is changing in my life through my writing, publicly, I don’t mention exciplicitly what is changing, but instead I just write. mostly about my beliefs, what I value, and the challenge I’m facing at the time. I do it multiple times throughout the year, and just by comparison, I can tell what changed. This self-reflection can help me distinguish between actual growth and commitments I made due to bad experiences, whether I adopted sudo-nihilism to cope with misfortunes, or if my pace in learning is slow and the road is very steep. All sorts of learnings in my journey are coming from my writings.\nAround 2018, I and Abd Alwahab Were arguing about some existential questions as teenagers while walking along the train track in the borders of our little small town district of Al-Daroshab , I came up with the realization that all the people who have died, are unable in anyway to share the lessons they have learned, not even as single lesson. through any channel. I remember that I never stopped talking about that idea with him that day. Years later, after deepening my understanding of our religion, Islam, the importance and encouragement of knowledge sharing, and the intolerance of not sharing knowledge.\nAlthough the priority is sharing the Islamic teachings and standing beside what is right. But I found that sharing small, minor details of our lives might be valuable. Scarcity of information: I was lucky that I was provided with an abundance of resources and access to people whom I can ask questions. I was raised having a computer, a brother to guide me through the installation of translators and IDEs on my machine, although he only just told me the names, but I was born lucky to some extent. I couldn’t even comprehend the idea of thinking about how my life would have been without having access to all the people and information. What I learned as a child significantly influenced the person I have become today. I never had the chance to appreciate this. Until a later period of my life, when I noticed a pattern of how the availability of information can lead to different lives.\nIn my primary-schooling period, I was smarter than most kids in “Computer” lessons and labs. And the teachers always ask me the following questions\n“Where did you learn this from?” or “Does your father come from an IT background?” so there must be a source of information, as they are assuming there is a light that must have guided you. something that sparked the first interest. That has led you to the person you are today. The same question is being repeated to students who are excelling in math (I suck at math), and looking back after I investigate them, they also had some sort of access to information (private tutor, aspirations, someone recommended a book for them), and so on.\nA model to understand information sharing. During my last year in high school, I started to view the world as a big network of knowledge/information sharing. I teach you computer science subject(what I use to do) and Abdalrahman (Math nerd who used to teach us mathematics) no matter how you are good in one subject you will always need help from different people, who are either in the same specialization that you’re looking for help with, or something else, This result of this processing of sharing information is to facilitate lives.\nWhat is wisdom does it have something to do with Making life much easier: I remember taking a consultation from Ali Azam one day about what university to pick, he told me that the university you’re going to pick will determine your next five years if not having a contribution to your whole life. He guided me through how its not just the name and reputation of the university but also the city where you live and ..etc a very concise definition of wisdom that I developed is: better decision making.\nAs I see many people are thinking about wisdom that same way as knowledge and whenever they heard the world a wise man they imagine someone who’s moving around with 200 IQ and quote to say everywhere. They ignore the fact that a wise man not only knowing but make actions and decisions based on his information.\nIf you zoom into your lifespan you would find there is this one component of decision making that significantly influenced your life today/the person who you are.\nThese decision are sometimes big ; whether to continue education or not, sometimes small; should I read today or play, the word decision is not about just being prompt to select between 2 or multiple choices, but it’s what you’re doing everyday you’re unconsciously calculate if you are going to sleep early or not whether you want to skip your leg day or study… etc\nEvery decision matter, not making a choice is also a choice\nThings I feel sorry about: One of the things I felt would make my life so much easier is knowing how to do math. Throughout my schooling period, I never encountered a math teacher who encouraged me to love math or helped me to do it; they did the exact opposite, except for the statistics and probability experience. And no wonder I love statistics more.\nWhen I entered university, I had to deal with all the previous experiences that had affected me. The access to top-tier students helped me make better decisions based on what they have experienced from success, failures, for instance, my senior Zainab helped me significantly understand math structure, and that I lack prerequisites for some courses.\nThis information sharing resulted in making my life easier. Sure, the math I had to deal with wasn’t easy, but in the hope of making this decision of going back to prerequisites, no matter how hard it is, it made my life later easier.\nI have seen people who never stop talking, but I couldn’t mine any useful information that would facilitate my life, while with little chatting with the most introverted person in the room, I can get advice that I never had the chance to know about.\nI shared my experiences in multiple aspects of life, whether it\u0026rsquo;s something big like joining a computer science school or not, or minor like recommending a software.\nWhile I was scared people would make a decision based on my experience, I kept emphasizing the idea that they should use the information they obtained from me as a data point, not final words, and it\u0026rsquo;s based on my experience, I try as much as I can to be unbiased and to tell what matches their needs. sometimes I receive messages from people saying that the decision they made has led a successful results, AKA make their lives so much easier. which I found very fascinating. most people who can help with information will be hesitant to share it, and even the failure when sharing it can be used as a decision making by someone else; this is basically how our lives work.\nThe reason why I’m writing these articles is the hope that there is someone who will make use of them in one way, taking a single idea that would inshallah help make their life easier.\n","title":"Why I'm Sharing Notes — Learned Too Late","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why_im_sharing_notes/"},{"content":"Progress: One of the good things I lack in my life is receiving feedback. Usually, everyone assumes that I’m an expert at everything, and they tend to define the way of our communication based on my social presence (oh, that’s Ahmed, everyone likes this dude. he is amazing… etc) while the reality is significantly different. I know several quality skills, like anyone, without having superpowers, I know how to speak, communicate, but I guarantee you I’m not the best!, and there is alot that you don\u0026rsquo;t know about me.\nThe problem is the iconography that the presenters who lead conversations/first time meets tend to define me with!

After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.\nOne day, I visited him at home and saw him packing up his bags, and some of his luggage was already packed. I was slightly irritated. he was so happy about his future, and I was happy for him too. Two years ago, I remember watching a video he shot that day, looking at myself, I could see how drowned I was in my thoughts, completely silent. Not many days passed before he booked his flight tickets.\nI went to the airport feeling completely numb . I even remember that my sister drove me, although I insisted on riding alone. I tried to make sure his journey went smoothly, helped him with the procedures, and it wasn’t long before I saw him hugging his family. That day, I didn’t grieve silently; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold myself. When he came to hug me one last time, I cried like a child. It was the most terrible feeling I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn’t stop myself from crying. I cried the entire way back home, at home, and again the next morning.\nFor the first time, my feelings rushed without control, without regulation, without avoidance; I got to see how vulnerable I was. With everything I had repressed before, the very distinct thought in my head was translated as: “I don’t know what to do with my life anymore.” It felt like I had lost myself. It felt like there was an important definition in my life that was suddenly gone. Even though the tears subside, writing this was never easy. I’ve tried to interpret what happened that day many times before, but most of the time I avoided thinking about it. Even now, while writing this, remembering it makes me cry like a child.\nThe days after he left were empty. I felt depressed and had no motivation to do anything. This eventually developed into severe social anxiety . I dragged myself into a cycle of illnesses and panic attacks that didn’t stop.\nFor almost four years, I hid my pain from him, how the days felt when he wasn’t around. I focused on how happy he seemed exploring a new world. I wanted to match his happy feelings, but two months ago, during a FaceTime call, the conversation suddenly shifted to the day he left. I was triggered and cried like a child again. I had never healed from the emotions I kept avoiding; they were always there, repressed.\nit was a goodbye I never recovered from, that particular departure triggered years of anxiety I was subconsciously avoiding by keeping myself busy, I miss you more than you can imagine, my friend. Not having you around was the hardest thing I ever had to go through.\n","title":"The Moment I Realized What He Meant to Me","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-moment-i-realized-what-he-meant-to-me/"},{"content":" your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.\nIt’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.\nAvoidant attachment is a pattern where you feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness and tend to pull away or shut down when relationships start to feel too vulnerable. Deep down, you may still want connection, but it feels safer to stay distant, guarded, or independent.\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of this term “Avoidant attachment,” and it is crazy how accurately it sums up and explains the recurrence of my patterns, Adding new friends systems , Elaborate Adding new friends system On avoidant attachment after watching videos about this topic, I felt it’s relevant to what I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing, and I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how mature psychology is, to the point of describing such a phenomenon. Below I will paste a comprehensive summary that can help understand the avoidant personality in a nutshell, and build on top of its light.\nYour avoidant isn\u0026rsquo;t fine, they\u0026rsquo;re just numb, to you it registers as indifference, what if they\u0026rsquo;re gone, what if they\u0026rsquo;re done, what if they\u0026rsquo;re over this, but internally on their part, it is an emotional shutdown. Avoidant don\u0026rsquo;t walk away calm, they walk away frozen, they don\u0026rsquo;t process in the moment, they don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened. They retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection. They are avoiding the emotional bill that just hasn\u0026rsquo;t hit them yet, because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them early, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them after a day or after a week, it hits them later on. When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone, and when they think that you have stopped expecting anything from them, that is the moment that it hits them. That\u0026rsquo;s when they start remembering the moment that they hurt you. And that\u0026rsquo;s when they finally feel what you felt in real time.\nThis piece is the first to encounter when searching for what this term means. I find it very accurate to the point I feel discomfort that there is someone out there is able to describe me in words, to have the words and explanation that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have, that I was searching for almost my entire life. I can see my own patterns here, by distilling this piece:\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened This explains the selective ignorance that I adapt\nthey retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection, this explains many of my disappearances because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame, all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you,this explains my writing state of numbness When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone; this explains why I avoided establishing direct relationship (closeness), and decided to use society buckets On the harm I caused others For a long time I believed I\u0026rsquo;m just not build for relationships, the moment someone brings emotions to our conversation I pull away, there is this poor Jonior whom I met recently and the moment he told me: “you\u0026rsquo;re cool, I like you, we could be friends”,As soon as he said that, I completely withdrew. and vanished from his life. Earlier this year I was talking to my friend Omer Monir. on how I’ve abundant the idea of romantic relationships in my life. Due to reasons I failed to interpret at the time, but the idea of I myself avoiding it, is a huge factor. What scares me the most about all sorts of relationships is the closeness and the commitment it brings, I can\u0026rsquo;t show up everyday, I\u0026rsquo;m terrified and not familiar with the intimacy that comes with establishing relationships, I run, I pull away and I shut down emotionally the moment these start to happen,\nthis explains why I freaked out when recently one of the uni colleagues told me I\u0026rsquo;m their best friend, I froze, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what did I respond with, he was so polite when he added the words “but I understand that you\u0026rsquo;re always busy and you don\u0026rsquo;t text too much, but I know that you\u0026rsquo;re a good man”, I was left speechless, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t say a word, I felt the guilt of how I\u0026rsquo;m not able to love them back the way they loved me. but at the end a person will only love you to the capacity in which they\u0026rsquo;re able to love themselves. I\u0026rsquo;ve failed many people before; they were victims of my avoidance, This dialogue helps me to imagine the kind of stress I put those people under.\nI\u0026rsquo;m being too much, the replies are getting colder, shorter, it\u0026rsquo;s like they don\u0026rsquo;t even care at all anymore, now I\u0026rsquo;m starting to freak out, because the only person I wanna talk to, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m interrupting them or I\u0026rsquo;m disturbing them, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m a burden, like I\u0026rsquo;m unwelcomed. Did I do something wrong, am I pushing them away, because they are not giving me the same energy that they did, I just want them to notice, I just want them to remind me that I matter to them.\nI once wrote how I\u0026rsquo;m really not good at putting myself in the other people shoes , and how I fooled myself into thinking people won’t be affected by my own patterns but in reality, I have hurt people, a lot of them, and I keep hurting more, by avoiding them, by showing up randomly and disappear frequently. It’s a strange grief to realize the amount of wounded people not out of cruelty I exposed, but out of an instinct, a second nature I caught before I ever had the words for it. The grief is even harder to bear when thinking that some people didn’t walk away from me; they walked away from the waiting. From my patterns. I only learned the cost after the silence became permanent.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful that the things I wrote in the past are finally becoming clear to me. A lot of friends helped to see this part of myself, how avoidant I am, including my best friend AbdAlwahab, and a bunch of victims. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this to result in a behaviour change soon, but at least for now, I can recognize my own patterns. At least for now, everything made sense.\n","title":"Learning the Truth About How I Love","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/a_grief_i_didnt_expect/"},{"content":"This piece of writing was part of an article I’m writing, about how I would help someone answering the question of “what do I want to do”, where I discuss how to pick a major and what helps you to define the way you contribute to this world. I found the draft of the article to be very lengthy, I may expected the reader to be aware of difference notions upfront, so I preferred this topic to be referenced here. As many of my drafts are pointing to it.\nIntro I started by highlighting how chasing long horizon questions can lead to unnecessary complexity that you might not have the tooling to unpack currently\nIt is not in your interest to waste time on investigating how the educational system started and why I need to get a degree in the first place, but rather to admit and sign up to the terms and conditions of this life. It is in your interest to know how to make the best use of your free will, if it was not, by your parents or conditions, to choose what you want to do in life. That might, but not necessarily result in your enrollment in a related field at the university, considering a topic as your side hustle or ultimately your profession, more on this later.\nConsent to the game rules is what I love to call accepting how the systems work, and agreeing to the terms and conditions that are dictated by our modern societies and cultures. What I will count as an example is the generalist/polymath who would argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to pick a major, or they want to consume more than one major; this can result in abandoning the educational system or not taking it seriously. I will consume all arts and sciences until the line drawing these distinctions diminish, they say. Although this is a bold claim that no one dares to hold, people underestimate the amount of discipline they need to maintain in order to achieve what their perception wove.\nI always think of the American Constitution promoting the amendments about the division of labor that, in order for the nation/community to grow and help optimize the metrics for its greater good, economics, innovation, fast food, and the good things we have in our modern societies. People should be specialists.\nthis is more of a reality check that defines the way the world functions, if happens and you are one of those people buying the idea of being a generalist, I\u0026rsquo;m not telling you to drop the idea, but most importantly telling you you\u0026rsquo;re swimming against the odds by being a generalist, and that you need to make sure your good plan of becoming a generalist helps you and ultimately us in providing something meaningful to the world and it is not a recursion. not just illusions of being special. Although someone might argue that the future belongs to those who combine different skills, for now, this is an example of resistance in consenting to the game rules.\nConsenting to the game requires being able to make sense of why the world is the way it is, and to be ready to take off all the chains holding you back from starting to contribute to the world, wether this is despair of how much evil exists in the world, or confusion of how disorder the systems are, skepticism because if any of this real, or if my doings matter, these questions regarding the game of life need to be answered to finally consent with a rested heart after all the searching to the game rules.\nbut as you can see, most of these questions are philosophical, they are about meaning, existence, identity, things that you will naturally experience the moment you you\u0026rsquo;re conscious, others might require you to explore politics and economics, what you need to do is simple, to just believe in the idea of making tomorrow a better day, to Reduce your suffering. because this will help you in the pursuit of existential clarity, and will yield you will stamina to purse answers in different directions, this worth a standalone article but the gist of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying is, if you want to find answers to the questions you are having, you need to be good with whatever will serve you in making tomorrow a better day, the same way you are good with the language, out of its importance in describing the universe, you need to be good and welcome with the things that will minimize the complexity of your situations, having an initial faith you will be facing the game rules (The nonsense you don\u0026rsquo;t understand) and use it as instrument for better you. if this might still abstract I might indeed to write a standalone point.\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t be thriving and winning unless you stand and consent to the game rules. Staying the same and doing nothing will only make it worst, so we pick what is less painful; to get up and find answers, to contribute to humanity with what we will find.\nFinding Answers Some of these questions you need to answer in order to consent willingly to the game rules can take years, and this is definitely not the best case scenario, especially in your case, where you want more answers to forecast accurately. However, the best case scenario is to have the ability to be selectively ignorant,\nSelectively Ignorant If you can classify these kinda of questions that will drag you into an infinite loop, it is better to carry on your work by ignoring these questions and having their burden in the background, in the hope that they will be answered one day. This will help minimize the complexity of your decision-making. Selective ignorance is applied in different parts of my life; maybe I will write more about it in the future.\nThat Will do My second advice is not to overthink whether the answers you\u0026rsquo;ve got are optimal, or if it\u0026rsquo;s an answer that made you feel good. If it fits and helps you in the process of getting closer to start consenting to the game rules, then use them as placeholders. The unveiled insights and joy of consenting to the game are more rewarding than the value of time wasted searching for the optimal. Do not care about the sources, it can come from something minor as a random quoted message you read on some random street walls written by a heartbroken lover, that you will consider as the last piece of the puzzle, TEDx talk, discussion with a friend. university course, whether your sources were science, religion.

I hesitated to make new friendships , I hesitated to share my writings publicly .\nThe reason is I was, and to this very day concerned with the questions that deviated me from being socially active. One of these questions is:\nWhat happens to a young person’s expectations about life when most of what they see one the internet are idealized stories, overly wise, unrealistic narratives? What happens to my community if this is the kind of discussion being shared publicly, which is mostly unproductive, pointless, trivial, and hollow? Can I change this?\nI\u0026rsquo;m still young, actively consuming data from the world, learning, and constantly changing. Sharing my opinions is not making the world a better place, I\u0026rsquo;m sure whatever I write be deprecated by my constantly evolving beliefs . so why bother writing? the world has enough of people talking, saying they want to make it a better place. The world is full of people who are more \u0026ldquo;qualified\u0026rdquo; to talk than myself although no one listens to them. Writing random quotes on social media that can mean different things to different people, or sharing a meme that can help someone heal, was enough for me.\nThis hides the part of my life I don\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable revealing in lengthy stories and lessons. The problem is that the majority of people end up using social media as a self help book. They look up to people\u0026rsquo;s achievements to get inspired, craving stories that match their personal circumstances and challenges. People are subconsciously building a map about the world using what is shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X…\nAn example: someone doubting their journey in learning finance، feeling lost in the equations, thinking they’re \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo; because everyone else seems to master the math effortlessly and even automate process in software tools. What people don’t say is that doubt is normal, and many of these equations aren’t intuitive at all, hardly understood at any given time. and It’s okay to feel confused Another example . someone just learning software engineering opens LinkedIn and feels left behind because people post about how they can solve noble problems using data science and machine learning software 2.0 they say. They may feel others are more impactful, and build the statement \u0026ldquo;all people working in data science are impactful\u0026rdquo; while in reality, most of these are demo projects, graduation projects, or research ideas far from implementation. I experienced the same when I first accessed the internet, consuming materials that seemed ideal, perfect, true, valid ,but are far from reality.\nNot explicitly mentioning our imperfections, hiding them, does not help. Packaging them in memes, stories, or art might provide temporary comfort and company for someone receiving, but it might not be good in the long run. I see this as one of the factors contributing to people\u0026rsquo;s despair these days. We tend to package our social appearance with what we find worth showing. Of course, you won\u0026rsquo;t go out there showing people all the insecurities you have. Telling them how you overcome social anxiety, they believe its a myth, or how awkward your hobbies are, you will be judged harshly. A few people do this. But in searching for perfection, we forget the most natural attributes of being human: being present , being emotional, being wrong.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m about to talk publicly or post on social media, I overthink if my writing matches all backgrounds and ages of my audience, if people would think I\u0026rsquo;m insecure about something, and if my writing is solid. That\u0026rsquo;s why I mostly write short quotes, not sharing experiences, lessons, or opinions, and ultimately suppressing my emotions.\nLife isn’t a set of solutions Life isn\u0026rsquo;t made up of a set of solutions for you to find.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built on extreme behaviors you learn to balance.\nAs a result of not engaging fully socially I have mastered controlling and potentially suppressing my emotions; which led to numbness . eventually I lost the meaning and pleasure of sharing my experience. the silence of surviving a day that no one knew about was hard, but the comfort zone I build covered this. Other factors include I\u0026rsquo;m very good at keeping myself busy and having master\u0026rsquo;s degree in wearing custom masks. By letting myself speak more honestly, I’m not only helping myself grow; I’m giving something back to the people who read me. If I share things as they are not polished, not idealized I might open a small space for someone else to breathe, to doubt safely, to feel normal again. And maybe this is how I contribute: not by being perfect, but by being real when most people aren’t.\nNow, I need to learn the opposite: I need to engage, to care. I need to feel and to love. To enhance the quality of my life, I must show my true colors without abandoning myself.\nI must stop wearing masks and let the changes that happen to me show up in my behavior with people. This way I can know who truly loves me and whose concerns include my problems.\nPerfect time does not exist if you wait, until everything feels finished, you gonna miss the people who would have loved you exactly as you are.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve waited for a long time to get it right, to feel certain that I finally figured it all out. That I will have a good map of reality which can define ideal human interactions for me. But this never happened, and I might waste my life waiting. And planning.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give this a shot I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to read books, rush the process of writing and publicly sharing, spend hours consulting friends, and form smaller communities to test my ideas. Did they work? Not entirely, but they provided lessons and information. I have no clue if this is just one of those random 3:00 AM bursts of motivation or if I’m finally tired of my own patterns, but one thing is sure: life rewards actions more than intelligence. I have a preliminary outline of what I want to do, and I should not overthink and drown myself in inaction. I will fail, it\u0026rsquo;s okay. I\u0026rsquo;m freaking out while writing this, but the signs point me to try. I will share more because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. Sharing my uncertainty can help someone; sharing my doubts when learning something can make someone\u0026rsquo;s day better. Sharing my insecurities can bring me people who help me overcome them.\nIn the end Having these pieces of notions connected and understood took me a long time. Yesterday, I was vulnerable, unaware of what I write here. My writing is not perfect; I could have used wiser words. Blind spots, potential mistakes, and pitfalls await me, but I welcome them, and I welcome whoever helps me in my journey.\nFor what is a man what has he got If not himself then he has not To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way.\n","title":"Learning to Feel Again","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/learning_to_feel_again/"},{"content":"I had a friend I met online who struggled with social anxiety. He used to tell me how he panicked at the idea of going to the university. I knew he wasn’t lying, but part of me couldn’t truly believe it, that a psychological disorder could control someone that much. I was telling him: you just needed to stop overthinking that people will hurt you, remind yourself there’s no reason to be afraid, and call it a day. Yes, I was ignorant. I tried to convince him to change something he couldn’t change, to “overcome it,” as if these were only voices in his head.\nIn 2022, I joined the University of Khartoum. I enjoyed the first few weeks before I flew out of the country and returned only for the first semester exam. like any freshman, I spent that first year in exploration, even though I was mostly abroad and only came back for exams and a few short periods.I was just given access to all sorts of materials. I just got good at googling things, MIT lectures, practical sessions, philosophy, logic, debates, activities. I wasn’t extreme/insane compared to people who signed up for every program and consumed whatever their eyes landed on, but I was selectively adding to my curiosity bucket, which happened to be very large. At that time, I was a firm believer in “having the skills” rather than just scanning books, which of course didn’t make me a healthy intellectual out of me, not the kind with good habits and healthy shape. No, it did quite the opposite. It put my health at risk.\nI had early signs that something bad was about to happen. I even mentioned this to my friend Kenyata , telling him how much I lack entertainment and simple enjoyment in my life. I was in Morocco at the time, I told him that when I return back to Sudan, I wanted to explore life a bit, pause from the grind, and see what people did outside academics and work. I told him I planned to try different restaurants. And honestly the reason I wanted to have a pause was that, my brother had been asking about my social life. He somehow convinced me it was important for my health to go outside, socialize and meet some friends. I took his advice seriously because he’s an introvert like me, and I hoped that piece of wisdom came from his own experience. But when I came back, I overloaded myself with even more tasks. I consumed even more material, aggressively. The social promise I made to my brother vanished, and I completely forgot the need to entertain myself.\nI remember that day clearly, the night before was long I spend the whole night awake and went into the exam without any rest, it was a calculus exam so you can imagine the amount of preparation I needed to put. after the exam, I went to the Computer Science department building at the faculty (the one basically colonized by IT students) for a reason I can’t even remember. I was somewhere in the middle of the first staircase. and without any premises I felt I was dying.\nI experienced a tunnel vision , I felt I was isolated from the world, My heart started beating so fast for no reason, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel normal at all. I was shocked to the point I could barely breath, I was lucky that the stairs had a handrail I can hold onto, I slowly made my way to the building\u0026rsquo;s entrance, where some seniors noticed there is something wrong with me, I\u0026rsquo;ve asked them to bring me water and mango juice (Maza) for some reason, maybe I thought it was a sugar problem. I was carried to what I think was the network admins office or something similar where I rested but my heart couldn\u0026rsquo;t slow down. Thankfully a girl from my batch called Esraa saw me and stood stayed with me stood by since,\nI was taken to the hospital, where they put all those sensors to my chest and ran different scans and tests. After about half an hour of that relentless, heavy heartbeat, my heart finally slowed down. I expected nothing less than a stroke or some kind of heart condition. I even had this dramatic thoughts that I might die from heartbreak for reasons I had woven in my head. I thought, This must be it.\nSurprisingly, all the scans were clean. I remember the doctor telling me my heart was “like a horse’s heart,” and that I didn’t have any heart disease. Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the horse\u0026rsquo;s heart analogy I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less, but It was a relief, although I was too mentally overwhelmed to process anything. I never followed up with the doctors to understand exactly what happened. My family arrived and took me home. My sister Zeinab, who is a doctor, told me it was a panic attack and explained what that meant. I watched some videos about it including this TEDx video I remember clearly, and I immediately related to it. I also joined online support groups and found comfort in hearing other people’s stories.\nI was healing from this accident by listening to the stories of people who experienced the same thing. Knowing that others had gone through similar circumstances that I wasn’t alone was reasonable to me to relief. But I never looked into why I was triggered in the first other than knowing “stress can lead you here, and it will reoccur when you trigger it again.”\nI eventually noticed a pattern: I felt discomfort whenever I was at the university. I remember this day very distinctly where I wanted any excuse not to go there. And luckily for me, the car I used to drive had almost no gas, and I wasn’t planning to stand in a long fuel queue. For but for some reason, though, I decided to go using public transportation, first a city train, then a bus. While crossing the bridge, Kobry Alhadeed, I started getting anxious. I felt afraid. And the closer I got to the university, the more scared I became. I can’t remember the lectures from that day, but it was the day I confirmed the pattern.\nWhat shocked me was what happened after the lectures. A friend told me he wanted to pick something up from the Computer Science department building and asked me to walk with him before we return back home.I found myself standing in front of the entrance, and my stress levels were extreme. I couldn’t enter the building. That’s when I knew: this was the thing I feared. I was afraid that if I entered that building again, something would happen to me.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the building is officially the “CS Department,” but it’s mostly used for IT lectures. Since I’m a computer science student, I was never required to be there, I had no courses inside that building. But I used to go there anyway because many of our friends had lectures there and were always hanging out. What I didn’t realize is that I had been avoiding it the entire time without noticing. I didn’t enter that building again until the course finished.\nWriting this now triggered me a bit. It seems that building really freak me out the most. While I was fighting these internal battles with panic attacks, the symptoms started to manifest as IBS. I thought it was genetic, most of my family has it, but my sister told me mine was caused by stress, and because you were very stressed recently, the IBS decided to accompany you. And she was right, the conversations I had with Kenyata about pausing the grind, was because a very subtle, inner voice was whispering to me, you need to take rest, but because I was exploring and the dopamine was always high, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t notice that I was under stress, stress that I love doing, stress out of things I loved, I later learned that even the things you love can make you sick, but it was too late. I noticed I only experienced the symptoms when I was stressed, not when I ate garbage food.\nDuring that period, a sudden shift hit my social life, it changed suddenly. I couldn’t hold conversations longer than a minute. I avoided people, especially the ones I knew well. I felt that if I talked too much, I would die. And I mean that literally, that’s how it felt. Talking to people I knew became the scariest thing ever. Almost everyone in my batch noticed. “Ahmed has changed.” Some even sat with me and asked what was going on. I’m not sure what I told them, but I’m sure I said something like, “everything is fine”, because I had no words to describe what I was going through.\nAnd suddenly, I had social anxiety. Me? Ahmed? the guy who initiated our batch group chat, who was nominated to be the batch representative, who used to be public and comfortable speaking. I wasn’t afraid of people. And now I had social anxiety? It was hard to believe. It was a dramatic shift. My online friend the one I used to make fun of when he told me he had social anxiety, I was slowly beginning to understand him, and to understand how ignorant I had been. I never imagined a day would come when my thoughts would no longer control my body.\nI was skeptical. I made several assumptions to explain what I was experiencing. The first was returning to the idea that I actually had a heart disease, because all the discomfort was happening in my chest and around my heart. The second was that I might be bewitched or cursed somehow. And the third was that it was a punishment from God, because I had once thought my friend was exaggerating his condition, and making things up. Between those assumptions, I was lost. I genuinely didn’t know what was happening to me.\nA new fear was unlocked during that time. where I went to picnic and I met some friends some of them for the first time, it is common in Sudan, we greeted each other with hugs, before handshakes. I remember seeing the first group of friends, and before we even hugged, my body was signaling that I should run, that I shouldn’t let anyone touch me. I\u0026rsquo;m someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like physical interactions, but not to the point of being terrified of it. I didn’t want this. I forced myself to hug them “normally”, and of course I didn’t die, but my stress levels was even higher than when I stood in front of the CS department building. At that moment, I believed for sure that I was bewitched. There was no way, that someone can get stressed and feel like they might die from hugging a friend, someone I should have been happy to see.\nAfter about two hours, another group of friends arrived, and when it came time for the hugging thing again, I partially fainted and fell to the ground. My friend Mustafa sensed my heartbeat; it was beating to the max. I don’t remember the exact dialogue, but they gave me something to drink and eat. And then I was fine again. They were confused because my explanations weren\u0026rsquo;t clear; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear to me either.\nI don’t remember a lot from that period because too many things were happening at once. But I do remember that after that picnic, I stopped meeting people entirely. I skipped university for several days. And it wasn’t long after that when the war started. To this day, I still can’t fully understand why all of this happened. But at least I evaluated my assumptions: I have came to the realization I wasn’t bewitched. After about eight months, I went back to working out and running, and being able to do those things easily, without any heart issues, boosted my confidence that I didn’t have a heart disease.\nI was gradually disappearing from people\u0026rsquo;s life, I had no motivation to talk to people, I have more things that are telling me not to connect with people, I mean if just hugs are doing this to do. lol, Looking back, I see many people who have no explanation for why I disappeared from their lives, why my behavior changed so drastically. Things weren’t good even before the war they were getting worse, but at least they eventually led me to understand that stress was the cause, even when I couldn’t feel the stress itself. One of the strange, almost funny stories from that time: several weeks after the incident, the right side of my face became completely paralyzed. I couldn’t move it at all. I went to the hospital, they diagnosed me with Bell’s palsy , a condition where the facial nerve on one side of the face suddenly stops working. And of course I was bewitched, of all the diseases that I know, I was given a weird paralysis in the face, someone must have wanted to torture me. After reading more about it, I learned that stress can also cause it. I rested my heart by saying, Stress is the cause.\nI remember I landed an internship but only went onsite for a total of three days. I remember barely speaking to my best friends during that entire period. I don’t remember much about how things were at home either, but I’m sure I kept myself constantly busy. Those days affected almost every part of my life. I tend to have a weaker memory for the bad times, but what I’ve written here are the extremes, the moments I simply couldn’t forget. The belief that I always had control over my mind and my body, that I can act as a commander was a heaven that I only realized when I lost control, when my mind and body turned against me.

I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.\nSean, Good Will Hunting (Park Bench Scene)\nAlthough my previous blog post was expected to be an explanation of what I assumed to be something I adopted a long time ago and never updated before:\nbut I have never revised the list since a while\nAdding new friends system I never expected the system to be perfect, or that I was doing what is ultimately right. The reason why I felt I should be listing this legacy system of adding new friends by writing the blog post , is because I felt it was the time to rethink it. I wasn’t explicit about this, (meaning it took me time to realize that I really need to rethink it.), but I felt this shouldn’t continue. The case analysis is not as good as it used to be in helping classifying people, many cases violated the rules, but the system still pulls me back to use its methods. [!IMPORTANT] I will be using the terms system and legacy system interchangeably. The term legacy system refers to an outdated but still functional computer system, software, or hardware that continues to be used because it performs its original, essential tasks, even as newer technologies emerge.\n[!NOTE] I deliberately selected the term value when saying assigning the name “Friend”, because it is not just a word, I consider it a value. Calling you a friend adds the values that require me to “allow myself to fall, to invest my emotions.”\nby this elboration I hope to clear the misconceptions that might accure from my previous writing, it build on top of the previous blog post Adding new friends system , you might want to take a look if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. this conversation will particularly discuss the cases where the system is not good enough, why I was still using it?, how it is so bad to the people who should be friends.\nWhy so many rules? Life is meant to be simple. There are many levels to look into why I don’t actually find it hard to rank people.one is Checklist based thinking happens everywhere, by everyone. First impressions are a sort of ranking system, and most people don’t take any effort in check listing their candidates, because it happens in the background of their minds, embedded just like first impressions.\nThe same happens to me, except that I might be using more rigorous tests. So I’m not really adding logic to the equation of life, it’s already there.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m not really walking around ranking people according to my checklist of what I favor, it is my mind that blocks me from transcending a relationship beyond what it is, unless it satisfies what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. this can act as a reason for why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so urgent about changing it, because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really suffering from it, it is something that happens almost naturally.\nAll the cool friends I could’ve made When establishing relationships, it is almost always the case that I don\u0026rsquo;t assign the value friend to them easily, lets call these people \u0026ldquo;candidates\u0026rdquo;, The best scenario is to have candidates who don’t care whether I gave this title to them or not; they don’t even ask about it. They see that I’m doing my best to match their energy.\nbut you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should\nAdding new friends system We’re supposed to enjoy the relationship without hindrance. I would do a great job at this, they would know I’m someone who never minds spending quality time with them, that I respect them, and am always happy to see them. Until they start to investigate their role within me too early.\nAnd if this happens, they won’t like it. They’ll translate me not adding them to the “friends” list as being heartless, as though they’re the ones taking part in the relationship, not me.\nI’d love if the universe worked according to my rules: why care about titles when I’m already there for you? But in the end, it’s not their fault. I shouldn’t have adopted this system in the first place, let alone explaining its creepiness to people or expecting them to understand it.\nHandling the misconceptions about “I will magically force myself to never invest emotions in the relationship” will take part shortly in this post, but for now, remember that the legacy system seemed to work for what I wanted it to do.\nhowever it does a greater job preventing “bad friends“. It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends) and this is where it helps me the most.\nAdding new friends system As long as it helps me make friends, and provides the definitions and rules of human interaction to me, I have no problem using it. But the real question is: why am I still using this legacy system?\nElaborating on the effects but there are downsides you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself.\nAdding new friends system Yes, I control the amount of love I stream toward someone/candidate, even if they were perfect candidates. I won’t send them any signals that strengthen our bond. I’ll avoid them. I’ll do what it takes to not invest emotion, and I’m good at it.\nI only stream what I think is sufficient to match their energy. The real downside is when this loop continues. They feel the walls I’m building hindering the relationship, and at that particular point I get disturbed.\nAt this stage, the best scenario is to respect the walls and plan to tear them down over time (though sometimes they’re never meant to be broken).\n1. Leakage in the system. In theory, I get to decide that I will not invest emotions, by controlling the amount of lets say love I stream for someone (love implies trust), just as computational theories ignore practical constraints, but in practice, emotions are not precisely controlled; they leak easily\n2. a double-edged sword. it is very common that I lose potential good friends in the process, and that hurts, seeing cool people leave. they realize how hard it is to deal with me, and then stop trying.\nThis cycle of people showing genuine interest in me, then suddenly losing it, is hard. It happened when I wasn’t aware that I had so many walls, that people aren’t good at climbing them. I was ignorant, selfish, not giving guidance on how to approach me.\nThinking it’s your thing to figure me out, who did I think I was? King Richard the Fifth? May I never trust my judgment again.\n3. But I\u0026rsquo;m hurt 2. What once felt unbearable to remember now feels necessary to recall. This one almost slipped out of memory, but when I lost those potential cool “friends,” I wasn’t happy about it. I remember now that I didn’t like it at all.\nI felt destined to live alone, not knowing I was drowning by my own design. I was too young to realize this. And instead of revising the list of rules I set to add new friends, to make them less rigorous, I fed it even more.\nWhy the legacy system is still in production Besides the system doing its job, there were boosters that helped keep it running.\nLet go before they let go:\nThe cycle of people entering and leaving my life left a scar. I started letting go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself caused these bad experiences to accumulate. It taught me that people leave, so I began preemptively leaving first.\n“People will stop trying to know you, you piece of shit. You’re setting the walls so high they won’t even try to climb them.” telling myself. And I had no idea that it was me causing this. That’s how two insecurities start boosting each other.\nThe legacy system is not helping me establishing new friendships (pending status cases). People are letting go of me because of this embedded legacy system. I let go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself helps me in the process of letting go of the people The legacy system says \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re anxious that they might leave you. I can help you to get rid of them preemptively.\u0026rdquo; The system rewards me by \u0026ldquo;either way, they might have been bad friends or they didn\u0026rsquo;t pass the tests\u0026rdquo;. man screw the tests.\nin short this monster was feeding itself. and apparently me.\nIrresistible features:\nMy sister once made an observation during a family discussion about our dark past selves. She noticed that growing up (me), I had access to the bad world, with tons of potential bad friends I could’ve made, but I chose not to.\nThe system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, actual true negatives, the ones that really would’ve hurt me. The problem is, it also keeps making false positives: rejecting people who were good, who could’ve stayed. It convinces me that losing them was just self protection,Though it’s hard to take the burden of \u0026ldquo;controlling the stream of love towards someone\u0026rdquo;, it’s also hard to be stabbed in the back. The system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, There was no other way, it was either being armed with it or being naïve and cut by friends.\nI’m good at keeping myself busy:\nThe legacy system not only controls how much love I give to people, it controls how many people I give it to.\nThose I call friends rarely exceed five or ten. I keep myself busy, which limits how many interactions I can manage. I’ve learned I don’t need to make a friend in every new country or city I live in, not doing so doesn’t kill me.\nI manage the few friends I have very well. They give me more than enough. I don’t plan to have many friends, it’s not aligned with my social energy or resources. The legacy system is good at controlling that number. It’s a win-win.\nAnswers not found elsewhere:\nSometimes I think about dismantling the system and moving on, but questions arise:\nHow do I prevent wounds if I step outside my walls?\nHow do I define friendship as something prestigious and not instantly given?\nThe first fence in the system is crucial, it helps control the number of people in my life. I can’t be friends with everyone I meet; I’d end up with too many.\nQuestions the legacy system fails to answer Some questions the system simply can’t answer well:\nWhat should I do if they figure it out?\nPeople go through painful ups and downs during the “pending” phase. They lose meaning in establishing a relationship once they realize they’re not assigned a value yet.\nI wasn’t trained to trust people this fast, but it’s not right to keep them hanging. The system doesn’t guide me here: should I explain it? Should I force myself to love them or assign the value they deserve?\nWhat should I do with pending requests?\nSome people are never meant to enter, I prefer keeping walls between us. The system doesn’t provide guidance.\nI remember a friend, culturally a friend, but I never really invested in him. He was great, but I didn’t want to allow myself to fall into that bond. Poor him, what did he have to do with my hormones? Again, the system didn’t help.\n404 Not Found:\nSometimes I fail to migrate relationships outside the scope of the greater good , that shared purpose that once connected us.\nI meet cool people in cool places; we like each other. But once the shared context is gone, I can’t find a new reason to stay connected.\nOutside the greater good:\nSome people are great under the scope of a project or purpose, but outside it, I can’t find what links us. Their attempts get pended.\nUndefined “something”:\nothertimes its more specific cases, For example, someone once part of my team, ideally female, wanted to get to know me outside of that shared goal. “Female friend”? I have no definition for that. How should I act? I don’t know, but I’ll definitely run away from anything undefined, lol.\nIf this isn’t your case, good for you. Some people don’t suffer from basic questions like deciding whether to make someone a friend or not. But I do, not enough to urgently change, but enough to notice it.\nI can still approach people, create one sided friendships, get what I need, make them smile, make them do what I want gently, wish them well, and support their wins.\nMost importantly, I can keep myself busy enough to avoid looking too closely at my malfunctioning legacy system.\ntoday! I’ve unlocked a hidden insecurity that’s been operating subconsciously, one I partly knew existed but never realized how much it was feeding other insecurities.\nThis moment of self-awareness feels like progress. I just need to unlearn it now. It might take years, but I’ve begun.\n","title":"Elaborate: Adding New Friends System","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"I get asked:\nHow do you deal with ordinary people? The ones that don\u0026rsquo;t bother you? and when does it start that they enter your life?\nThis question has got me thinking. I recalled that checklist (set of rules) I have for making new friends, but I have never revised the list for a while. I have seen cases where people just hack the system, and suddenly they are knocking on the door of my heart before even check-listing half of it.\nThe set of rules I have adapted is simple enough to help me make new friends; however, it does a greater job preventing “bad friends.” It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends), and this is where it helps me the most. More about it later; first, let’s get to see where this starts.\nIn elementary school, I made the observation that most people around me complain about how they were betrayed, stabbed in the back, or any sort of resentment that happened to them, caused by relationships, particularly friendships. To make sense of why they suffer, my observation was: “All these people you were hurt by, you had positive feelings about them; you loved them.\u0026quot; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be in such a position, so I learned through preaching to myself.\nthe equation was obvious to me: \u0026ldquo;the more emotions I invest in someone, the deeper the wound is,\u0026rdquo; and you start investing emotions in people the moment you assign them the name \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; in your head. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall this equation resulting in me being afraid of making friendships, but what I did was to learn from them. What I learned is that many cases were wounded because they were too early in assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the people they met.\nAs social creatures, we tend to make friendships in the new places or paths we take (new school, new university, new habit…) or sometimes when we feel lonely, or even worse, when we are too optimistic. However, these reasons do not respect the slow pace needed for making friendships; they are in a rush. For example, a fresher might feel either very overwhelmed by the number of questions they got, so they try to establish friendships (either to feel no guilt if people also turn out not to have answers, or to have answers), or very energized by the amount of sudden freedom they were never granted before, and they want to make friends to do all sorts of crazy things they want to do. So whether your reasons were noble (work on study groups, research, projects, politics) or less impactful (host parties, go to the park), they are all tagged with urgency. Of course, you can\u0026rsquo;t wait two years to make a friend.\nFor these very reasons, \u0026ldquo;bad friends\u0026rdquo; happen, that we needed to call someone a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; we had tons of emotions that couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold their horses and needed someone to run for.\nHow I planned to overcome this? Simply don\u0026rsquo;t call people your \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; I haven’t used that term for as long as I can remember. My very first friend, I was telling myself about \u0026ldquo;Wow, this guy has done so much for me. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to call him a friend, then I\u0026rsquo;m selfish and heartless\u0026rdquo;. What people don\u0026rsquo;t understand is that I still had a quality time with that guy without calling him a friend. I was enjoying my life with them, and I was making memories.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve applied what happened with the first person I ever admitted by heart as a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the friends I met down the road, is to never call them friends until time passes and they prove they are trustworthy.\nIf you keep saying everyone is your friend, you will end up wounded alot.\nBut there are downsides, you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you are going to be in defense mode all the time (or it is not that bad; maybe you will get used to it), but you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should. But don\u0026rsquo;t call them friends, not yet, because the moment you start assigning them the value \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; you allow yourself to invest more emotions (trust, love, loyalty…). If you have an argument saying friendship should not be that hard, and at the start I don\u0026rsquo;t really allow myself to fall completely, then this is good for you, but for me, no. Assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to people means a lot more, so I don\u0026rsquo;t give it away that easily. Luckily, society gave us names as placeholders for people that even can help define the interactions and limits of relationships to have with people: there are Coworkers, Neighbors, Classmates, Colleagues, Managers, Team members, Collaborators, Customers, Clients, Students, Teachers, and even Mutuals (your friend\u0026rsquo;s friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be your friend). Why don\u0026rsquo;t people use these? They are good, they protect you, they help you.\nGoing back to our discussion, the reason why I want to revise my set of rules for making new friends as mentioned before is that there seem to be people who violate the rules. They are just cool enough to make friendships with; they can\u0026rsquo;t stay just \u0026ldquo;people,\u0026rdquo; they need to be \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; And they already have the same amount of admiration as my friends, but I\u0026rsquo;m yet to call them \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; This nonsense happens for a lot of reasons; let\u0026rsquo;s list some:\nThe experiences I went through in making friends were very long in terms of duration, and this is purely by chance. My very first friends took a long time to call them friends — years. This was reflected in some way in my subsequent experiences (I started to consider taking more time just as how my first friendships took more time to bond). This might be nonsense, but that means even if someone passed the checklist in under six months, and they were finally qualified to be \u0026ldquo;friends,\u0026rdquo; without a year or two passing by, I can\u0026rsquo;t call them friends.\nIn simple terms, the way I formed friendship was that I get to know people very slowly and we disappear for years in the middle. This reflected that I don\u0026rsquo;t make people friends easily.\nAnother reason is to be mindful of the greater good we are serving. This is very common in relationships of University and Work because there is often a greater purpose that must be served and is compromised the moment we call ourselves \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; A good example would be a woman called Samar Yahia. Samar ages me by about ten years. We were co-founders of a startup at some point, and we just met. I never knew who she was, she knew who I am, and we never met to this very day although we live in the same city. Why? Simply because we prioritize the greater good of the startup by being co-founders/co-workers. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a great time; we had amazing conversations, laughter, we shared experiences and life lessons, we allowed ourselves to enjoy the process, and never made it boring. But let\u0026rsquo;s just not take it to the next level of being friends even if it feels right. If I ever get the chance to meet Samar in an alternative world, we would have been great friends, or if we had something other than work.\nThe last one is that I want to protect either myself or someone by not going to be a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; and it is better to have walls between. An example would be: Ahmed is a cool new freshman at the university, and I want to take him under my wings by making friendship with him, aka investing emotions. But I might not do that. Although he passed the checklist and is now a good candidate, I might prefer to keep the default relationship (colleague) assigned to him. Why? Well, since he is too young, I’m not sure if by this sudden access to all sorts of amusement and ideologies, he will remain the one I hoped to make friendship with. This way I can protect myself from making friendships with Ahmed. Another pattern that happens a lot, is the other way around: University colleagues try to get to know me outside the University, and they are often pushed by walls I build to protect them from me. I don’t want them to invest their emotions in me because I don’t see myself as trustworthy, that I\u0026rsquo;m not someone they can really rely on, and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust myself to handle that responsibility, at least not yet. This way, I protect them (and many times hurt them) using the walls I build and keeping them away from my friends zone, and most importantly, keep myself away from their friends zone.\nAt the end, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just a traumatized kid formalizing all these rules to make friendship. In reality, I don\u0026rsquo;t really suffer from this. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m good at reaching out to people and making friendships. I don\u0026rsquo;t struggle to communicate with people or get what I want. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a bad time searching for quality time. And thinking about how much worse it could be without these rules, I remind myself to be grateful.\nWhat kind of walls do you mean exactly?\nThe first one, I assume, is to act ordinary (which is a product of the walls but it\u0026rsquo;s just the first fence), acting ordinary is to not reveal the basic information about me, my name, my age, what I do in life. But this layer is fragile, once I\u0026rsquo;m asked, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind answering, it helps me save time and avoid making unnecessary relationships, I can\u0026rsquo;t count the amount of cool and bad people I could have made in life if I had never had this first wall which I now call the fence (it assumes acting dumb while knowing, being nonchalant while I\u0026rsquo;m a bit interested(this one started to fading recently I gotta get my shit together), sharing misguided information about me).\nThe most important wall is the privacy wall. I only allow a certain amount of information to get leaked from what I\u0026rsquo;m doing in my life. What I want to do. I\u0026rsquo;m not giving or sharing what violates my privacy. this includes (my family, my moves, my trips, my quality time, my free time, my friends, my performance, my upside-downs)\nless in height, subtle insecurities I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to involve people in.\n","title":"Adding new friends system","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"To nerd out and talk about a particular topic that you are deeply interested in/ obsessed with, requires you to unveil part of yourself. Your personality, your affection, your love for that topic. Often, it feels like dancing in the symphony of that subject(my analogy is very consumed, but I feel it holds true here).\nWhile jumping between discussions on Substack , I found myself watching this Kurt Vonnegut lecture.\nWatch the lecture Although I enjoyed the whole presentation, I was most impressed by his performance in the final minutes, the way he left the stage, his funny moves and gestures. This wasn’t unique to the ending, though. The way he spoke and carried himself throughout the lecture was “unique.”\nUnique to him.\nIt felt like this was how his soul interpreted information or felt about it, how it reacted to the joy of sharing his inner reasoning and experiences. You could sense the years of thought and accumulation behind every word. The jokes, the gestures, the rhythm, they were all expressions of his love for what he was saying.\nI found myself imagining a kind of paradise around the idea that he was never ashamed of being himself. Because when you look at him, he was doing weird stuff, awkward moves, overly specific jokes, yet the audience loved it. They understood and accepted his (uniqueness soon will be called awkwardness). They even craved it.\nuniqueness is just him being true to himself, acting natural and manifesting what he feels in the way he likes\nif this uniqueness exists in an alternative world, a world where he couldn’t be himself freely, where his natural self would be judged as strange akward. where his uniqueness is akwardness.\nWatching him leave the stage while everyone clapped, appreciating what he had shared, reminded me of how many intellectuals from my country travel abroad to pursue their careers in the United States or other Western nations that seem to value what they can offer.\noften saying,\nMy skills were welcomed in the country of Uncle Sam.\nThis isn’t about how the United States has built the perfect habitats for nerds and anyone who wants to be themselves; by embracing people as they are and shaping social norms around tolerance, rather than judgment.\nIt’s more about how bad I feel coming from regions where being your true self is misunderstood, misused, and simpy is a crime.\nAt that particular moment, watching him leave the stage, I remembered how unlucky we are for not growing up in environments that encourage us to nerd out, to share the things we are obsessed with in our own way, or even to share them at all.\nYou don’t know how many times I’ve tried to have deep discussions with people who are truly good at something(they are nerds about particular subject), just to crack through their insecurities and show them:\n“I’m a good listener. I won’t judge. Only love. I won’t be freaked out by your awkwardness. I’m more interested in hearing you express your passion naturally, not formally or shyly. You know you’re obsessed with it deep down — and there’s no reason to feel guilty about that with me.”\nCracking those defense walls is never easy.\nAnd it’s not their fault.\nIt’s the world they were born into, one that never prioritized who they truly are.\n","title":"Where You Are Allowed To Be You","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/where_you_are_allowed_to_be_you/"},{"content":"When making decisions in life, especially when we are faced with selecting between two events, we find ourselves comparing how important they are in order to determine which event we should choose. Some people study the implications of each decision and measure how rewarding or penalizing the outcomes might be. Picking the least penalty is a tactic for choosing a decision under this scenario.\nI first encountered this three years ago in one of Jeff Bezos’s interviews. he called it the Regret Minimization Framework. This tactic can be used on a smaller scale, even in daily decisions like getting out of bed or not. I’m sure you’ve used this tactic today in your own decision making process as a kind of mental tool. Usually, it helps me clarify priorities and take action with confidence. But what I’m here to share is a funny story: for the very first time, I was unable to use this utility in my decision making process.\nTwo events were taking place in the same hour block the next morning (8:00 AM). To make a decision, I defaulted my brain to use the regret minimization method. Unfortunately, the two events were equally likely in their consequences, at least from what my mind could list. Of course, life can have consequences that shows the advantages of one selection over the another, but I’m yet to know this and I need to make decisions under what I only know, and able to consider at the particular time I’m given this.\nIt felt exactly like how mathematical reasoning falls apart when dividing by zero, or how classical physics fails to explain things at small scales. This dilemma, of having two equally important events with either equally likely outcomes or vague consequences, made the regret minimization method fail completely. And honestly, that was a funny realization, because I’m rarely hesitant in making decisions. I know exactly what if I want to make a decision over another.\nMaybe I expected too much from this method,or misused it,but that’s not really the point I want to highlight. Perhaps this reflection doesn’t offer a grand piece of wisdom, but you can still take something from it: explore new ways of making decisions in your own life. Experiment with frameworks or tactics that help you choose the optimal option more often. And most importantly, pick an option, don’t stay up until (3:42 AM) like me, still undecided and unable to sleep.\n","title":"The Limits of the Regret Minimization Framework","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_limits_of_the_regret_minimization_framework/"},{"content":" Everyone is atheist until the plane starts falling. I have no clue who said this.\nThe numerous different stories that act as catalysts for returning to God and thinking about the existence of a grand designer or creator, shared by people across the globe, are interesting. There are a variety of patterns, and often the most interesting ones are those concluded through epistemic rationality rather than convenience or bias—where there was evidence that God existed, for them. One pattern is how God existed in everyday life. A good example is the historical belief that the creation of all temples and religions around the world throughout history is an innate, lowkey, subtle need for God.\nAnd this is what I’m interested in pulling strings from and building upon—what I felt right before I sleep. I’m not diving into theology, but rather sharing a concept I just coined: “Gratitude Register.” This is what I assume as the “where I find God” in my “everyday life pattern.” No matter what beliefs I’m holding or how religious or spiritual I am at a particular point in time, at the end of the day (literally) I find myself accounting for what was good today and in my life. This happens by default; it’s the way your psyche validates the day, your memory works, and you yourself try to make sense of all the nonsense you were doing throughout the day. Depending on how I define good (which of course includes biased beliefs or definitions from religion), I can bring different combinations of them. Now, if these things outweigh the misfortunes I have, that means it is a good day (again, there is no agreed upon way of defining and measuring misfortunes). Hence, some positive feelings may start to appear—one that stands out so loudly is gratitude. This feeling is a well known visitor, outshining others through its powerful urge.\nGratitude: “I’m here.” Translation: I’m grateful. Gratitude: “I need to make a decision so fast (urge).” Translation: I need to be grateful “for someone.”\nTranslation is what the mind tells about the chemicals.\nThis urge—and the small space I get to make the decision to fill it with someone—is what makes gratitude such a special “positive feeling.” This is how I translate it as a way to know God, and I’m feeling it every day. To know this Gratitude Register (just like how a CPU register is filled quickly and needs to assign the value to some process) requires some form of mental allocation.\nIf it happens and if I’m a full time atheist (I don’t wish that for anyone) I believe this interaction, of validating my day and unconsciously inviting “gratitude” as a result of just being human, shall rescue me from muddle and may guide me toward the light.\nThis is a piece of my honest and truthful analysis of my feelings toward gratitude.\n","title":"Gratitude Register","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/gratitude_register/"},{"content":" do things badly\nAs the years pass by, I find myself adapting to different reasons to keep living, and to share, I\u0026rsquo;m not as clear as I used to be about why I should be posting something publicly, but looking back over the years, I recall how writing started. How reasons changed.\nThe Seeds of Writing I\u0026rsquo;ve had amazing language teachers (Tahia and Jamal), who encouraged me to write and read since I was a little I\u0026rsquo;ve been under the wings of people who are naturally good at writing (this probably influenced me, I mean, I used to write poetry when I was a little) I felt the need to express my feelings through writing (I\u0026rsquo;ve been actively journaling since 8th grade) I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen in love with quotes and I became a collector at some point, they seemed to explain the world, so I started crafting my own through writing (High school/teenager period) I\u0026rsquo;ve wished people could write more about their experiences and not generic content When I needed someone to talk about Computer Science from their heart, experience, and not what they have studied Reem\u0026rsquo;s blog was my savior, and then later I loved the writings of Mohammed Yousif especially the self-reflection notes, and his feelings. I wanted to document my journey in life, I wished that the elderly people in my life had books/blogs that they had left behind for me, so I can get to know them more, even after they\u0026rsquo;re gone. I wanted to make sense of my doings, I would write the task I should be doing for myself to see if I understand the procedure that is supposed to happen, and if there are any subtle pitfalls in my understanding I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of. Yes, these are all different reasons, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how I\u0026rsquo;m going to organize them, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to overthink this.\nDemons but I got demons\u0026hellip;. that were holding me from writing.\nI get amazed by the number of clicks I write on the keyboard everyday writing something. and it is really fascinating how I barely share it publicly. I\u0026rsquo;m not in my best to recall the WHY behind why I\u0026rsquo;ve been skeptical about this, but below are what I can list now:\nBeing busy is the biggest factor for not sharing it publicly, not that I can\u0026rsquo;t press post/publish but that I have a cognitive overload from being busy, I get to experience and learn lesson on the fly which I assume its a bless. but it comes in huge numbers and sometimes hard to unpack what I\u0026rsquo;ve learn. so they time between me taking the lesson and preparing to share the lesson spans, if I assigned a name to this period, lets say C, there will even more lessons that will pop in that period which lead to me giving up completely on sharing.\nNot making sense of how this would help me. there was a time where I\u0026rsquo;ve had lost the meaning and I was blinded by something that I don\u0026rsquo;t know, the prevented me from seeing how this can help me in any way (practically speaking, yes I had reasons to write but not to share)? (later I found some reasons to share).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the writing tools: at that age being afraid is the default, I was telling myself if that x human is better than you at writing and knows how why would you still share? they got the experience, they got the talent, the got the time, they got the confidence. looking to back to how small I was to start such a thing makes sense.\nDo people call it a comfort zone?: I recall in 2023-2025 I stopped a number of my social media accounts repeatedly, until this very day, I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet posted one single status on my main WhatsApp account. And months can pass without sharing something publicly, now this has its own story, but it was one big reason that I\u0026rsquo;ve felt comfort in not being in public/ in not sharing, even if that is on social media.\nPrioritize what\u0026rsquo;s important: there is also a time when I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at the words that I\u0026rsquo;m writing, and that I should be sharing, but not to everyone, maybe I can do this to my closest people first, family, and friends. They deserve better, someone who is not being busy, but being responsive and collaborative. So throughout the last 2 years, I was investing more in my closest circle.\nDetails and setup: everyone has their own unique way of communicating, with mutual culture you get to say what you want smoothly (by smoothly I mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t face difficulties in deciding what to say and the recipient is not having trouble interpreting your words to what you actually meant) if we were to imagine how deviated I\u0026rsquo;m from that line, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not as close. maybe in reality I can relate and talk to people, but inside my head I overthink and over-engineer what I should say to the person in-front of me based on the data they are directly or indirectly steaming to me, will they relate to what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, are they comfortable talking about this, are they going to feel offended, am I talking fast, and not showing them the point, did I match their energy/slang, was the conversation interactive?, dozens of questions, now image you are talking to over thousand person, thats what I put in my mind and heart before sharing anything publicly. Now these details are hard to overcome.\nI\u0026rsquo;m wasting my time here: this is a real demon here, it tells me that the time I would spend in writing and then responding to people\u0026rsquo;s comments, inquiries, friendships, rituals out of curiosity about me from my posts, can be dedicated to doing something more useful, I would spend more time doing more important things maybe.\nmoving forward This blog website is an attempt; it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be the last one, but I have faith in it.#\n","title":"Why I’m Sharing Notes","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-do-this/"},{"content":" Early to rise early to bed, makes a man healthy but socially dead\nOne thing that i\u0026rsquo;m sure about is, that I don\u0026rsquo;t miss people easily, not that I don\u0026rsquo;t bare people, or I\u0026rsquo;m antisocial. but I keep myself busy to the point I forget about the people, I feel sorry for myself and for the people I know that I\u0026rsquo;m emotionally inactive when I need it.

I thank Allah for blessing me to live this long. Those first 21 years were upheavals.\nI grew up playing video games and memorizing/reciting Quran under the mentorship of Shiekha Entisar, my best friend’s mother. I had the chance to pursue an education. Even though I was a high performer, I scored only average on entrance exams and never paid attention to my academic pursuits during the bottleneck years that mattered the most.\nLately I learned to love my family and friends. I also learned to dislike certain kinds of people. I’ve been listening, whether I’m interested or not, because it always helps me understand more. And I’ve been keeping quiet during moments when I had so much to speak up.\nI have been, and to some point still am, a generalist. I spend half of my time doing things consistently and the other half exploring new things whenever they appear. As a result of my constant consumption, I became socially awkward, developed IBS, and struggled with severe social anxiety.\n","title":"The First 20 years of my life in a nutshell","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/21_reflections/"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s May 6, and I will be turning 21 in less than a month. I used to document at this time of the year, where I try as much as possible to reflect on the progress made this year, perhaps my learning process. Alhamdullah, I have learned a lot. And I have tales to tell, but hopefully, choosing the most significant one will find a wider audience and fit. I will talk in 3s three categories and 3 notes\nI will talk about What I learned about the world What I learned about the people What I learned about myself. I\u0026rsquo;m not very visionary and dreamy, so I think about life directly, but here are some lessons that I learned.\nWhat you learn models the way you think. We try as much as possible to interpret the complexity of the world and answer the why and how behind things; the way we think and use our minds is completely different based on what we have learned, and dictates how we will view the world. If that\u0026rsquo;s chemistry, you will look at life as a chemical reaction, a mathematician viewing it as a melody of logic, a writer as stories, and so on.\nThe reality has nothing to do with your hope. Life is very unpredictable; you can\u0026rsquo;t say good things happen for good people, or I have put too much into this project hence it will succeed, life has nothing to do with your hope.\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t pursue happiness directly. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall when was the last time I heard someone asking whether you are happy or not, and how to be happy. It looks like everyone is suddenly not talking about happiness, which is good in my opinion. Happiness is something you pursue indirectly.\nhere comes the people. Unexpected Time Sink You respawned in this world hoping that you would spend most of the time doing what you love, but then you realized that a great portion of your time is dedicated to people, some of them whom you might like, and others you will force yourself to adapt wasting time with.\ncheerful face and sweet words You can get what you want with a cheerful face and sweet words: People hold positions, some of them control the valves of opportunities. What I found is, besides having the potential to fit the need, if you have reached out, cold emailed, or any sort of communication, people will help you make things out.\nPeople have feelings, I guess. They feel, every single action you do influences the way they look at you. If you never show up for their invitations, if you were a bit off that day, your tune changed. I fooled myself for a long time, thinking that people would never notice the small things that I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\nAbout me. Struggle to see things from their perspective I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I can\u0026rsquo;t fully understand someone else\u0026rsquo;s situation unless I have been through something similar or if I am able to simulate/mimic/imagine the same circumstances. For instance,, if I live in the big city of Khartoum with a 9 - 5 job anda regular pace of life, I will never be able to generalize what people might suffer from and what challenges they face in different parts of Sudan. I just can\u0026rsquo;t.\nKeeping up, what is that? I\u0026rsquo;m the worst when it comes to keeping up with people and the news. In order to feel natural and get along with most of today\u0026rsquo;s youth and even adults, you need to have a middle ground to talk about, in most cases, football, politics, and news, which I don\u0026rsquo;t really bother myself to follow. So this is one of the things I learned that I simply suck at bringing topics to the middle ground.\nAvoiding Regret I love video editing/storytelling, tho I\u0026rsquo;m not editing as much as I used to, but it\u0026rsquo;s still one of the things that I loved doing naturally and unconditionally. I never admit to saying it verbally, but the reason I\u0026rsquo;m making videos is to capture a snapshot of time, just like git versions the code. The main incentive behind doing this action. is to avoid regret. I can\u0026rsquo;t live with this burden in my chest. There are dozens of videos that I discarded, many of which I\u0026rsquo;ve never started. Tens of drafts have never seen the light, and a bit over 50 were sent privately to the once i trust the most. so my advice to you is.\n","title":"21","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/21/"},{"content":"Things I was wrong about Recently, I came to the realization: I’m not giving people what they deserve. I don’t make it easy for them to stay close to me, not only strangers, but even the people who care about me the most. I build walls, my mood is forever changing around them, and constantly not around. And I know this is wrong. I noticed that at the beginning of relationships, I can match people’s energy effortlessly, but over time I gradually drift back into being distant and cold. It feels unfair, it\u0026rsquo;s hypocrisy. either I shouldn’t appear friendly in the first place, or I should remain consistent with the way I start. which is being friendly forever.\nCRM when thinking about these problems, I found out I was not up to the promises I tell myself, although I want to check on people I love from time to time, I don\u0026rsquo;t do that, I just can\u0026rsquo;t maintain it, I fail every time, I recently came to the term, Customer Relation management where business people keep track of their customers, and found a video that talks about applying this idea into tracking your social life.\nWhen I thought about these problems, I realized I wasn’t living up to the promises I made to myself. Even though I want to check on the people I love from time to time, I just don’t do it. I just can’t maintain it; I fail every time. Recently, I came across the term Customer Relationship Management, where businesses keep track of their customers, and I found a video talking about applying the same idea to tracking your social life. where you keep track of customers and call when you, its just a system that companies use to remember their customers.

All my attempts seem to fail.\n","title":"I Keep Failing the People I Care About","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/i_keep_failing_the_people_i_care_about/"},{"content":" I’m not sure if it exactly look as I imagine it\nZeinab\nThe first time I encountered this idea was when talking to Zeinab Sami 016 FMSI, while I insisted that she must study how stochastic processes are involved in machine learning, she responded with something that falls into the idea: “Your perception of this major might be different from reality.”\nIndirectly, she helped me to adapt this as a new way of thinking when picking majors throughout my life, whenever we plan to study something new we might have initial assumptions about it, its almost the case, that our minds are not null when we study new materials, we do not only take assumptions with us, but also attach information we hear along the road with it. with extra imagination.\nMost of us have heard the term quantum mechanics, and you probably have imagined the nature of how these types of studies are, no matter how far your assumptions are from true, say you have been hesitating to enter an engineering degree due to your imagination of previous engineering classes or things that you have learned that helped you to generalize to the engineering concept. I’m not the best at making analogies, but I will tell the story of stochastic processes and my conversation with Zainab. She’s a Computer Science major who devoted more time and effort to mathematics while also maintaining good grades in CS related subjects. She shared me the work of a mathematician in stochastic processes after winning a Nobel prize on his word, or Fields Medal I really can’t recall it. we were arguing about how he managed to imagine these things, let alone architecting a framework to explain it, Although we tried to “wonder” but we come from completely different backgrounds, as I see stochastic processes from practical Machine Learning point of view, mainly thinking of “if I never set a random seed I might never reproduce my same results again, my weights will always initialize randomly, the gradient will always give different results/trough when minimizing the cost function”, Zainab is coming from a completely different background thinking about the mathematics how differential equations are implemented…etc.\nThis idea of things being as you imagine them, or as the image you are able to craft by generalizing from previous experiences, is something I often think about.\nHow to benefit from this lesson. Assuming you want to study a material in a new subject that you have never studied before, you will have generalization ability to predict how it\u0026rsquo;s going to be, but the reality might be different. and sure it is different, from the things that you can think of, it is always better to do the process to know how things are. quantum mechanics seems like you will be imagining where the cat is, what will happen if I observe it, but in reality, you will be doing differential equations, which will shape the framework of how you think about these problems. So this might let you think twice that THINGS ARE NOT AS YOU IMAGINE them, don’t let your assumptions fool you.\nInstead, it should be a part of your learning process, when you hit the realization of what actually this topic is talking about, for a very long time, I thought calculus is about calculation, after reading it I knew that it was talking about the rates of changing, and now I view as the art of dealing with tight spaces, and I will keep changing my assumption about it as I go, or maybe adding to the previous once. so having this flexibility will always help.\n","title":"What you want to major in might not be exactly what you imagine it to be","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/what_you_want_to_major_in_might_not_be_exactly_how_you_imagine_it/"},{"content":"Lately, I lost my ability to focus and maintain a flow state. I don’t sleep late, I eat relatively healthy food, and I’m not dopamine addicted. The problem comes down to practices that would align your efforts with what you want to achieve.\nToday, and after 15 days of nonsensical hard work (definitely I learned, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t comfortable learning), I get an hour with myself, having a lovely flow state, I will note and try to list all the things that I have done to get my focus back. 1. Sleeping early (70%) The percentage here indicates the importance of the action and how it contributes to the focus during the day, sleeping early isn’t new to me, I noticed that not doing this step, will degrade my performance (mentally \u0026amp; physically) particularly mentally, the physical condition can be refreshed after 1:00 PM or in the middle of the day, but the mentally is ever lasting throughout the day. But doing this step alone (i.e, validating how just sleeping early can affect your focus/performance) is not highly rewarding; it’s more of a prevention than a boost, which prevents you from having a bad day/focus rather than boosting you with flow state.\n1. Waking up early(90%) Now this is the most important part, sleeping early is not enough, you need its complement, which is waking up early, whether you slept at 9:00 PM or 12:00 AM\nWaking up early always makes it better to concentrate.\n","title":"Flow State and Sleep","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/flow_state_and_sleep/"},{"content":"I once read:\n“one of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know, someone in your class might find your presence inviting and warm even if you’ve exchanged a few words with them or maybe none at all, someone on the street loves your smile and it brightens their path for the next few blocks, someone who regularly comes to work is disappointed when you aren\u0026rsquo;t there, someone missed you today, someone noticed when you’re gone, someone loves you when you’re there, someone loves you when you’re nowhere to be found at all, you might think you have always disappeared when you’re no longer in the picture, but you never left the frame”\nAs far as I remember, this quote is the very reason I no longer question why people might feel my existence in their lives is adding value. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t project myself to if I were the “people”… do people help in my life indirectly, or without them knowing? Unlike my previous answers, which were showing independent personality and actions that didn’t need the “people” in their space. I found that sometimes people do change the way I think, talk, the frequency of doing something good, the latency of retrieving meaning from something, the hope and the discovery. Sometimes it’s crystal clear how I\u0026rsquo;m affected by their doings, other times it’s indirect; only their existence will bring every good part of me to life again.\nIt really sadness me that I was loved by many, more than I thought, I recently published a video, after a long time of me being distant, people went crazy sending to me and asking how I’m, and most of them notice that I was not around recently, I was fooling my mind that social life is not important, wether you are present or not, people will forget you, in short, it is hard to admit, but there are people out there who love us more that we know.\n","title":"The greatest tragedy in life","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_greatest_tragedy_in_life/"},{"content":"It was a rainy day when I realized that I was 19 years old, and I only had a few months left to turn 20.

I have experienced life and responsibilities, but surely the 20s will be different, and I tried to answer one question: what am I afraid of? Why I’m afraid of being 20: and it turns out it is not only one question,but I was filled with lots of questions:\nWhat do I want to do for the rest of my life? What do I want to keep? What do I want to quit? Who will I stay with? Which people would I leave? Will I be able to practice my hobbies as the time I need to make videos and pursue my cinematography projects? What would happen to the way I think? Will my beliefs keep helping me? Will I remain a robust young dreamer or a dull mechanic worker in this fast world? Will I ever be able to never forget what I wanted to achieve? Will I be able to go through the mud as I entered the 20? Will the opportunities come? Will the things I love remain the same? Would I remain settled even after experiencing my 20s?

And it will come back to me. I’m turning 20 next week. Here are some lessons I think I learned in my teens, I may change my mind about some of them in the future.\nYour family must be no.1 priority in your life. You must have one thing that your life revolves around(Religion, category of people). People are not good at understanding themselves. Being Busy can prevent you from doing stupid things, and at the same time from good things, make sure to balance. Sleep early and wake up early. Don’t create competitions that doesn’t exist, be realistic. You can explore life in your teens and 20s and be a generalist, but set a limit for that and try to specialize and focus on the important parts. Routine is the small steps you take towards every big goal you set for yourself. A good level of understanding yourself, is knowing what you are not good at. If you’re a junior and you think you are smarter than an old outdated seniors, think twice; they have experience. Someone may find your presence warm and lovely without you knowing, so always be kind. If people do like you and you don’t know why, try to know why and keep practicing this thing for the rest of your life. Memories are the most warm feeling in the world, and the time you’re remembering them, will always be a happy time. I guess Happening is something that you pursue indirectly. Pray to Allah for giving you a clear mind, and practice exercise, eliminate distractions and you will have super flow state. Our beliefs are changing every time and we probably notice that late. If you ever felt happy for no reason try to ask yourself why? Write it down and read it when you’re down. Being optimistic about something and putting massive emotions into it doesn’t mean it will succeed. Reality is just independent of your thoughts Sad, or in pain? This will always come back at some point; you gotta use the time you have when you’re at your best. You may hurt people without knowing that you did, so you need to make sure you apologize frequently and ask people about how you behave. Chasing one thing will make the other things run away, like chasing a job but your health is in danger. You can be good at anything, including research and engineering, without a university, but the university is still important. We are not alike in the way we receive new information and knowledge; some know how to extract every possible information out of it, while others don’t. Mainstream titles like “entrepreneurship” can wait, and people who are seeking it since early ages of their career or uni want only the money, but they don’t have the needed skills and capacity to be the one. You may be good at using one of the technologies that uses scientific methods, but till you should always be humble to that outdated professor who spends his life solving equations and teaching math that you see as useless. You just didn’t realize the importance of it yet and the impact he is having. Avoid blaming your family members ","title":"20","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/20/"},{"content":"One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on Facebook , not consistently, and then I went through what I called “ Manulasis ”(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.\nThis happened because of the overwhelming number of times I discarded posts, notes, videos, or images I intended to share. Eventually, I gave up and abandoned the whole idea, and in doing so, I vanished from reality. This hesitation wasn’t new to me; I’ve been repeating this pattern since childhood. I would have sudden peaks of exposing my thoughts to the world, followed by long troughs of detachment and isolation. The amount of life that happens during those troughs makes it difficult to say everything when I finally try to reconnect with the world again.\nIf I turn a blind eye to the complexity, one of the strongest incentives behind sharing my notes is the fear of regret . I have been running from this feeling most of my life. The idea that all the messages, reflections, and thoughts I discarded will haunt me in the future terrifies me. This fear is closely tied to the feeling of standing on the Day of Judgment, knowing I had something that might help someone, but I never shared it. Recording what I’ve learned is a way to pass something forward to future generations.\n","title":"Why Im Sharing Notes - Regret","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-im-sharing-notes-regret/"},{"content":" There\u0026rsquo;s an anecdote about Richard Feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on Mr Feynman desk and makes a comment about these being a record of Feynman\u0026rsquo;s thinking and then Mr Feynman corrects the historian and says that: these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you\u0026rsquo;re thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that\u0026rsquo;s when Mr Feynman says: no they aren\u0026rsquo;t a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.\nIf I were to say the most important feature of making my life interpretable, it would be writing. I make sense of what is changing in my life through my writing, publicly, I don’t mention exciplicitly what is changing, but instead I just write. mostly about my beliefs, what I value, and the challenge I’m facing at the time. I do it multiple times throughout the year, and just by comparison, I can tell what changed. This self-reflection can help me distinguish between actual growth and commitments I made due to bad experiences, whether I adopted sudo-nihilism to cope with misfortunes, or if my pace in learning is slow and the road is very steep. All sorts of learnings in my journey are coming from my writings.\nAround 2018, I and Abd Alwahab Were arguing about some existential questions as teenagers while walking along the train track in the borders of our little small town district of Al-Daroshab , I came up with the realization that all the people who have died, are unable in anyway to share the lessons they have learned, not even as single lesson. through any channel. I remember that I never stopped talking about that idea with him that day. Years later, after deepening my understanding of our religion, Islam, the importance and encouragement of knowledge sharing, and the intolerance of not sharing knowledge.\nAlthough the priority is sharing the Islamic teachings and standing beside what is right. But I found that sharing small, minor details of our lives might be valuable. Scarcity of information: I was lucky that I was provided with an abundance of resources and access to people whom I can ask questions. I was raised having a computer, a brother to guide me through the installation of translators and IDEs on my machine, although he only just told me the names, but I was born lucky to some extent. I couldn’t even comprehend the idea of thinking about how my life would have been without having access to all the people and information. What I learned as a child significantly influenced the person I have become today. I never had the chance to appreciate this. Until a later period of my life, when I noticed a pattern of how the availability of information can lead to different lives.\nIn my primary-schooling period, I was smarter than most kids in “Computer” lessons and labs. And the teachers always ask me the following questions\n“Where did you learn this from?” or “Does your father come from an IT background?” so there must be a source of information, as they are assuming there is a light that must have guided you. something that sparked the first interest. That has led you to the person you are today. The same question is being repeated to students who are excelling in math (I suck at math), and looking back after I investigate them, they also had some sort of access to information (private tutor, aspirations, someone recommended a book for them), and so on.\nA model to understand information sharing. During my last year in high school, I started to view the world as a big network of knowledge/information sharing. I teach you computer science subject(what I use to do) and Abdalrahman (Math nerd who used to teach us mathematics) no matter how you are good in one subject you will always need help from different people, who are either in the same specialization that you’re looking for help with, or something else, This result of this processing of sharing information is to facilitate lives.\nWhat is wisdom does it have something to do with Making life much easier: I remember taking a consultation from Ali Azam one day about what university to pick, he told me that the university you’re going to pick will determine your next five years if not having a contribution to your whole life. He guided me through how its not just the name and reputation of the university but also the city where you live and ..etc a very concise definition of wisdom that I developed is: better decision making.\nAs I see many people are thinking about wisdom that same way as knowledge and whenever they heard the world a wise man they imagine someone who’s moving around with 200 IQ and quote to say everywhere. They ignore the fact that a wise man not only knowing but make actions and decisions based on his information.\nIf you zoom into your lifespan you would find there is this one component of decision making that significantly influenced your life today/the person who you are.\nThese decision are sometimes big ; whether to continue education or not, sometimes small; should I read today or play, the word decision is not about just being prompt to select between 2 or multiple choices, but it’s what you’re doing everyday you’re unconsciously calculate if you are going to sleep early or not whether you want to skip your leg day or study… etc\nEvery decision matter, not making a choice is also a choice\nThings I feel sorry about: One of the things I felt would make my life so much easier is knowing how to do math. Throughout my schooling period, I never encountered a math teacher who encouraged me to love math or helped me to do it; they did the exact opposite, except for the statistics and probability experience. And no wonder I love statistics more.\nWhen I entered university, I had to deal with all the previous experiences that had affected me. The access to top-tier students helped me make better decisions based on what they have experienced from success, failures, for instance, my senior Zainab helped me significantly understand math structure, and that I lack prerequisites for some courses.\nThis information sharing resulted in making my life easier. Sure, the math I had to deal with wasn’t easy, but in the hope of making this decision of going back to prerequisites, no matter how hard it is, it made my life later easier.\nI have seen people who never stop talking, but I couldn’t mine any useful information that would facilitate my life, while with little chatting with the most introverted person in the room, I can get advice that I never had the chance to know about.\nI shared my experiences in multiple aspects of life, whether it\u0026rsquo;s something big like joining a computer science school or not, or minor like recommending a software.\nWhile I was scared people would make a decision based on my experience, I kept emphasizing the idea that they should use the information they obtained from me as a data point, not final words, and it\u0026rsquo;s based on my experience, I try as much as I can to be unbiased and to tell what matches their needs. sometimes I receive messages from people saying that the decision they made has led a successful results, AKA make their lives so much easier. which I found very fascinating. most people who can help with information will be hesitant to share it, and even the failure when sharing it can be used as a decision making by someone else; this is basically how our lives work.\nThe reason why I’m writing these articles is the hope that there is someone who will make use of them in one way, taking a single idea that would inshallah help make their life easier.\n","title":"Why I'm Sharing Notes — Learned Too Late","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why_im_sharing_notes/"},{"content":"Progress: One of the good things I lack in my life is receiving feedback. Usually, everyone assumes that I’m an expert at everything, and they tend to define the way of our communication based on my social presence (oh, that’s Ahmed, everyone likes this dude. he is amazing… etc) while the reality is significantly different. I know several quality skills, like anyone, without having superpowers, I know how to speak, communicate, but I guarantee you I’m not the best!, and there is alot that you don\u0026rsquo;t know about me.\nThe problem is the iconography that the presenters who lead conversations/first time meets tend to define me with! They overglorify my story and the person I am, and this is not serving me in any way. The smarter the presenter will present you, the more independent you are likely to become.\nAnd that was always the case: people treated me based on what they heard about me, and probably that was brighter in a way that blinded what they would hear from me later. All my attempts to correct that, are prone to failure.\nFeedbacks! In the early days of the university, the first feedback I got from my colleagues where something like; You look like a robot, you don’t seem to know what feelings are. And indeed, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing my best at camouflaging as a human, although I was good at communication, but people always felt lost finding the way to enter my sphere. So I decided to be more friendly, and I took it so seriously, it brought some results in many different aspects. But the feedbacks are gone, the compass I used to make the decision based on is no longer here.\n","title":"Lack of Real Feedback","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/lack_of_real_feedback/"},{"content":"I remember coming back to Sudan from Saudi Arabia when Abd Alwahab told me he had secured a scholarship in India and might travel to pursue it. After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.\nOne day, I visited him at home and saw him packing up his bags, and some of his luggage was already packed. I was slightly irritated. he was so happy about his future, and I was happy for him too. Two years ago, I remember watching a video he shot that day, looking at myself, I could see how drowned I was in my thoughts, completely silent. Not many days passed before he booked his flight tickets.\nI went to the airport feeling completely numb . I even remember that my sister drove me, although I insisted on riding alone. I tried to make sure his journey went smoothly, helped him with the procedures, and it wasn’t long before I saw him hugging his family. That day, I didn’t grieve silently; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold myself. When he came to hug me one last time, I cried like a child. It was the most terrible feeling I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn’t stop myself from crying. I cried the entire way back home, at home, and again the next morning.\nFor the first time, my feelings rushed without control, without regulation, without avoidance; I got to see how vulnerable I was. With everything I had repressed before, the very distinct thought in my head was translated as: “I don’t know what to do with my life anymore.” It felt like I had lost myself. It felt like there was an important definition in my life that was suddenly gone. Even though the tears subside, writing this was never easy. I’ve tried to interpret what happened that day many times before, but most of the time I avoided thinking about it. Even now, while writing this, remembering it makes me cry like a child.\nThe days after he left were empty. I felt depressed and had no motivation to do anything. This eventually developed into severe social anxiety . I dragged myself into a cycle of illnesses and panic attacks that didn’t stop.\nFor almost four years, I hid my pain from him, how the days felt when he wasn’t around. I focused on how happy he seemed exploring a new world. I wanted to match his happy feelings, but two months ago, during a FaceTime call, the conversation suddenly shifted to the day he left. I was triggered and cried like a child again. I had never healed from the emotions I kept avoiding; they were always there, repressed.\nit was a goodbye I never recovered from, that particular departure triggered years of anxiety I was subconsciously avoiding by keeping myself busy, I miss you more than you can imagine, my friend. Not having you around was the hardest thing I ever had to go through.\n","title":"The Moment I Realized What He Meant to Me","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-moment-i-realized-what-he-meant-to-me/"},{"content":" your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.\nIt’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.\nAvoidant attachment is a pattern where you feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness and tend to pull away or shut down when relationships start to feel too vulnerable. Deep down, you may still want connection, but it feels safer to stay distant, guarded, or independent.\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of this term “Avoidant attachment,” and it is crazy how accurately it sums up and explains the recurrence of my patterns, Adding new friends systems , Elaborate Adding new friends system On avoidant attachment after watching videos about this topic, I felt it’s relevant to what I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing, and I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how mature psychology is, to the point of describing such a phenomenon. Below I will paste a comprehensive summary that can help understand the avoidant personality in a nutshell, and build on top of its light.\nYour avoidant isn\u0026rsquo;t fine, they\u0026rsquo;re just numb, to you it registers as indifference, what if they\u0026rsquo;re gone, what if they\u0026rsquo;re done, what if they\u0026rsquo;re over this, but internally on their part, it is an emotional shutdown. Avoidant don\u0026rsquo;t walk away calm, they walk away frozen, they don\u0026rsquo;t process in the moment, they don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened. They retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection. They are avoiding the emotional bill that just hasn\u0026rsquo;t hit them yet, because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them early, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them after a day or after a week, it hits them later on. When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone, and when they think that you have stopped expecting anything from them, that is the moment that it hits them. That\u0026rsquo;s when they start remembering the moment that they hurt you. And that\u0026rsquo;s when they finally feel what you felt in real time.\nThis piece is the first to encounter when searching for what this term means. I find it very accurate to the point I feel discomfort that there is someone out there is able to describe me in words, to have the words and explanation that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have, that I was searching for almost my entire life. I can see my own patterns here, by distilling this piece:\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t sit with the tension, and they don\u0026rsquo;t face what they did and what actually happened This explains the selective ignorance that I adapt\nthey retreat into the one thing that makes them feel safe, which is disconnection, this explains many of my disappearances because for an avoidant, the guilt, the loss, the shame, all of it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit them right in the same moment that it hits you,this explains my writing state of numbness When the dust has settled, when the thread of closeness is gone; this explains why I avoided establishing direct relationship (closeness), and decided to use society buckets On the harm I caused others For a long time I believed I\u0026rsquo;m just not build for relationships, the moment someone brings emotions to our conversation I pull away, there is this poor Jonior whom I met recently and the moment he told me: “you\u0026rsquo;re cool, I like you, we could be friends”,As soon as he said that, I completely withdrew. and vanished from his life. Earlier this year I was talking to my friend Omer Monir. on how I’ve abundant the idea of romantic relationships in my life. Due to reasons I failed to interpret at the time, but the idea of I myself avoiding it, is a huge factor. What scares me the most about all sorts of relationships is the closeness and the commitment it brings, I can\u0026rsquo;t show up everyday, I\u0026rsquo;m terrified and not familiar with the intimacy that comes with establishing relationships, I run, I pull away and I shut down emotionally the moment these start to happen,\nthis explains why I freaked out when recently one of the uni colleagues told me I\u0026rsquo;m their best friend, I froze, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what did I respond with, he was so polite when he added the words “but I understand that you\u0026rsquo;re always busy and you don\u0026rsquo;t text too much, but I know that you\u0026rsquo;re a good man”, I was left speechless, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t say a word, I felt the guilt of how I\u0026rsquo;m not able to love them back the way they loved me. but at the end a person will only love you to the capacity in which they\u0026rsquo;re able to love themselves. I\u0026rsquo;ve failed many people before; they were victims of my avoidance, This dialogue helps me to imagine the kind of stress I put those people under.\nI\u0026rsquo;m being too much, the replies are getting colder, shorter, it\u0026rsquo;s like they don\u0026rsquo;t even care at all anymore, now I\u0026rsquo;m starting to freak out, because the only person I wanna talk to, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m interrupting them or I\u0026rsquo;m disturbing them, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m a burden, like I\u0026rsquo;m unwelcomed. Did I do something wrong, am I pushing them away, because they are not giving me the same energy that they did, I just want them to notice, I just want them to remind me that I matter to them.\nI once wrote how I\u0026rsquo;m really not good at putting myself in the other people shoes , and how I fooled myself into thinking people won’t be affected by my own patterns but in reality, I have hurt people, a lot of them, and I keep hurting more, by avoiding them, by showing up randomly and disappear frequently. It’s a strange grief to realize the amount of wounded people not out of cruelty I exposed, but out of an instinct, a second nature I caught before I ever had the words for it. The grief is even harder to bear when thinking that some people didn’t walk away from me; they walked away from the waiting. From my patterns. I only learned the cost after the silence became permanent.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful that the things I wrote in the past are finally becoming clear to me. A lot of friends helped to see this part of myself, how avoidant I am, including my best friend AbdAlwahab, and a bunch of victims. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this to result in a behaviour change soon, but at least for now, I can recognize my own patterns. At least for now, everything made sense.\n","title":"Learning the Truth About How I Love","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/a_grief_i_didnt_expect/"},{"content":"This piece of writing was part of an article I’m writing, about how I would help someone answering the question of “what do I want to do”, where I discuss how to pick a major and what helps you to define the way you contribute to this world. I found the draft of the article to be very lengthy, I may expected the reader to be aware of difference notions upfront, so I preferred this topic to be referenced here. As many of my drafts are pointing to it.\nIntro I started by highlighting how chasing long horizon questions can lead to unnecessary complexity that you might not have the tooling to unpack currently\nIt is not in your interest to waste time on investigating how the educational system started and why I need to get a degree in the first place, but rather to admit and sign up to the terms and conditions of this life. It is in your interest to know how to make the best use of your free will, if it was not, by your parents or conditions, to choose what you want to do in life. That might, but not necessarily result in your enrollment in a related field at the university, considering a topic as your side hustle or ultimately your profession, more on this later.\nConsent to the game rules is what I love to call accepting how the systems work, and agreeing to the terms and conditions that are dictated by our modern societies and cultures. What I will count as an example is the generalist/polymath who would argue that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to pick a major, or they want to consume more than one major; this can result in abandoning the educational system or not taking it seriously. I will consume all arts and sciences until the line drawing these distinctions diminish, they say. Although this is a bold claim that no one dares to hold, people underestimate the amount of discipline they need to maintain in order to achieve what their perception wove.\nI always think of the American Constitution promoting the amendments about the division of labor that, in order for the nation/community to grow and help optimize the metrics for its greater good, economics, innovation, fast food, and the good things we have in our modern societies. People should be specialists.\nthis is more of a reality check that defines the way the world functions, if happens and you are one of those people buying the idea of being a generalist, I\u0026rsquo;m not telling you to drop the idea, but most importantly telling you you\u0026rsquo;re swimming against the odds by being a generalist, and that you need to make sure your good plan of becoming a generalist helps you and ultimately us in providing something meaningful to the world and it is not a recursion. not just illusions of being special. Although someone might argue that the future belongs to those who combine different skills, for now, this is an example of resistance in consenting to the game rules.\nConsenting to the game requires being able to make sense of why the world is the way it is, and to be ready to take off all the chains holding you back from starting to contribute to the world, wether this is despair of how much evil exists in the world, or confusion of how disorder the systems are, skepticism because if any of this real, or if my doings matter, these questions regarding the game of life need to be answered to finally consent with a rested heart after all the searching to the game rules.\nbut as you can see, most of these questions are philosophical, they are about meaning, existence, identity, things that you will naturally experience the moment you you\u0026rsquo;re conscious, others might require you to explore politics and economics, what you need to do is simple, to just believe in the idea of making tomorrow a better day, to Reduce your suffering. because this will help you in the pursuit of existential clarity, and will yield you will stamina to purse answers in different directions, this worth a standalone article but the gist of what I\u0026rsquo;m trying is, if you want to find answers to the questions you are having, you need to be good with whatever will serve you in making tomorrow a better day, the same way you are good with the language, out of its importance in describing the universe, you need to be good and welcome with the things that will minimize the complexity of your situations, having an initial faith you will be facing the game rules (The nonsense you don\u0026rsquo;t understand) and use it as instrument for better you. if this might still abstract I might indeed to write a standalone point.\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t be thriving and winning unless you stand and consent to the game rules. Staying the same and doing nothing will only make it worst, so we pick what is less painful; to get up and find answers, to contribute to humanity with what we will find.\nFinding Answers Some of these questions you need to answer in order to consent willingly to the game rules can take years, and this is definitely not the best case scenario, especially in your case, where you want more answers to forecast accurately. However, the best case scenario is to have the ability to be selectively ignorant,\nSelectively Ignorant If you can classify these kinda of questions that will drag you into an infinite loop, it is better to carry on your work by ignoring these questions and having their burden in the background, in the hope that they will be answered one day. This will help minimize the complexity of your decision-making. Selective ignorance is applied in different parts of my life; maybe I will write more about it in the future.\nThat Will do My second advice is not to overthink whether the answers you\u0026rsquo;ve got are optimal, or if it\u0026rsquo;s an answer that made you feel good. If it fits and helps you in the process of getting closer to start consenting to the game rules, then use them as placeholders. The unveiled insights and joy of consenting to the game are more rewarding than the value of time wasted searching for the optimal. Do not care about the sources, it can come from something minor as a random quoted message you read on some random street walls written by a heartbroken lover, that you will consider as the last piece of the puzzle, TEDx talk, discussion with a friend. university course, whether your sources were science, religion. Whatever will do. do not change a word\n","title":"Consenting to the Game Rules","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/consenting_to_the_game_rules/"},{"content":" Sister Calderon: I don\u0026rsquo;t know but..whenever we happen to meet you\u0026rsquo;re always helping people and smiling.\nArthur: You\u0026rsquo;re too smart for me sister..I guess I..I\u0026rsquo;m afraid.\nSister Calderon: There is nothing to be afraid of mister Morgan.

I hesitated to make new friendships , I hesitated to share my writings publicly .\nThe reason is I was, and to this very day concerned with the questions that deviated me from being socially active. One of these questions is:\nWhat happens to a young person’s expectations about life when most of what they see one the internet are idealized stories, overly wise, unrealistic narratives? What happens to my community if this is the kind of discussion being shared publicly, which is mostly unproductive, pointless, trivial, and hollow? Can I change this?\nI\u0026rsquo;m still young, actively consuming data from the world, learning, and constantly changing. Sharing my opinions is not making the world a better place, I\u0026rsquo;m sure whatever I write be deprecated by my constantly evolving beliefs . so why bother writing? the world has enough of people talking, saying they want to make it a better place. The world is full of people who are more \u0026ldquo;qualified\u0026rdquo; to talk than myself although no one listens to them. Writing random quotes on social media that can mean different things to different people, or sharing a meme that can help someone heal, was enough for me.\nThis hides the part of my life I don\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable revealing in lengthy stories and lessons. The problem is that the majority of people end up using social media as a self help book. They look up to people\u0026rsquo;s achievements to get inspired, craving stories that match their personal circumstances and challenges. People are subconsciously building a map about the world using what is shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X…\nAn example: someone doubting their journey in learning finance، feeling lost in the equations, thinking they’re \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo; because everyone else seems to master the math effortlessly and even automate process in software tools. What people don’t say is that doubt is normal, and many of these equations aren’t intuitive at all, hardly understood at any given time. and It’s okay to feel confused Another example . someone just learning software engineering opens LinkedIn and feels left behind because people post about how they can solve noble problems using data science and machine learning software 2.0 they say. They may feel others are more impactful, and build the statement \u0026ldquo;all people working in data science are impactful\u0026rdquo; while in reality, most of these are demo projects, graduation projects, or research ideas far from implementation. I experienced the same when I first accessed the internet, consuming materials that seemed ideal, perfect, true, valid ,but are far from reality.\nNot explicitly mentioning our imperfections, hiding them, does not help. Packaging them in memes, stories, or art might provide temporary comfort and company for someone receiving, but it might not be good in the long run. I see this as one of the factors contributing to people\u0026rsquo;s despair these days. We tend to package our social appearance with what we find worth showing. Of course, you won\u0026rsquo;t go out there showing people all the insecurities you have. Telling them how you overcome social anxiety, they believe its a myth, or how awkward your hobbies are, you will be judged harshly. A few people do this. But in searching for perfection, we forget the most natural attributes of being human: being present , being emotional, being wrong.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m about to talk publicly or post on social media, I overthink if my writing matches all backgrounds and ages of my audience, if people would think I\u0026rsquo;m insecure about something, and if my writing is solid. That\u0026rsquo;s why I mostly write short quotes, not sharing experiences, lessons, or opinions, and ultimately suppressing my emotions.\nLife isn’t a set of solutions Life isn\u0026rsquo;t made up of a set of solutions for you to find.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built on extreme behaviors you learn to balance.\nAs a result of not engaging fully socially I have mastered controlling and potentially suppressing my emotions; which led to numbness . eventually I lost the meaning and pleasure of sharing my experience. the silence of surviving a day that no one knew about was hard, but the comfort zone I build covered this. Other factors include I\u0026rsquo;m very good at keeping myself busy and having master\u0026rsquo;s degree in wearing custom masks. By letting myself speak more honestly, I’m not only helping myself grow; I’m giving something back to the people who read me. If I share things as they are not polished, not idealized I might open a small space for someone else to breathe, to doubt safely, to feel normal again. And maybe this is how I contribute: not by being perfect, but by being real when most people aren’t.\nNow, I need to learn the opposite: I need to engage, to care. I need to feel and to love. To enhance the quality of my life, I must show my true colors without abandoning myself.\nI must stop wearing masks and let the changes that happen to me show up in my behavior with people. This way I can know who truly loves me and whose concerns include my problems.\nPerfect time does not exist if you wait, until everything feels finished, you gonna miss the people who would have loved you exactly as you are.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve waited for a long time to get it right, to feel certain that I finally figured it all out. That I will have a good map of reality which can define ideal human interactions for me. But this never happened, and I might waste my life waiting. And planning.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give this a shot I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to read books, rush the process of writing and publicly sharing, spend hours consulting friends, and form smaller communities to test my ideas. Did they work? Not entirely, but they provided lessons and information. I have no clue if this is just one of those random 3:00 AM bursts of motivation or if I’m finally tired of my own patterns, but one thing is sure: life rewards actions more than intelligence. I have a preliminary outline of what I want to do, and I should not overthink and drown myself in inaction. I will fail, it\u0026rsquo;s okay. I\u0026rsquo;m freaking out while writing this, but the signs point me to try. I will share more because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. Sharing my uncertainty can help someone; sharing my doubts when learning something can make someone\u0026rsquo;s day better. Sharing my insecurities can bring me people who help me overcome them.\nIn the end Having these pieces of notions connected and understood took me a long time. Yesterday, I was vulnerable, unaware of what I write here. My writing is not perfect; I could have used wiser words. Blind spots, potential mistakes, and pitfalls await me, but I welcome them, and I welcome whoever helps me in my journey.\nFor what is a man what has he got If not himself then he has not To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way.\n","title":"Learning to Feel Again","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/learning_to_feel_again/"},{"content":"I had a friend I met online who struggled with social anxiety. He used to tell me how he panicked at the idea of going to the university. I knew he wasn’t lying, but part of me couldn’t truly believe it, that a psychological disorder could control someone that much. I was telling him: you just needed to stop overthinking that people will hurt you, remind yourself there’s no reason to be afraid, and call it a day. Yes, I was ignorant. I tried to convince him to change something he couldn’t change, to “overcome it,” as if these were only voices in his head.\nIn 2022, I joined the University of Khartoum. I enjoyed the first few weeks before I flew out of the country and returned only for the first semester exam. like any freshman, I spent that first year in exploration, even though I was mostly abroad and only came back for exams and a few short periods.I was just given access to all sorts of materials. I just got good at googling things, MIT lectures, practical sessions, philosophy, logic, debates, activities. I wasn’t extreme/insane compared to people who signed up for every program and consumed whatever their eyes landed on, but I was selectively adding to my curiosity bucket, which happened to be very large. At that time, I was a firm believer in “having the skills” rather than just scanning books, which of course didn’t make me a healthy intellectual out of me, not the kind with good habits and healthy shape. No, it did quite the opposite. It put my health at risk.\nI had early signs that something bad was about to happen. I even mentioned this to my friend Kenyata , telling him how much I lack entertainment and simple enjoyment in my life. I was in Morocco at the time, I told him that when I return back to Sudan, I wanted to explore life a bit, pause from the grind, and see what people did outside academics and work. I told him I planned to try different restaurants. And honestly the reason I wanted to have a pause was that, my brother had been asking about my social life. He somehow convinced me it was important for my health to go outside, socialize and meet some friends. I took his advice seriously because he’s an introvert like me, and I hoped that piece of wisdom came from his own experience. But when I came back, I overloaded myself with even more tasks. I consumed even more material, aggressively. The social promise I made to my brother vanished, and I completely forgot the need to entertain myself.\nI remember that day clearly, the night before was long I spend the whole night awake and went into the exam without any rest, it was a calculus exam so you can imagine the amount of preparation I needed to put. after the exam, I went to the Computer Science department building at the faculty (the one basically colonized by IT students) for a reason I can’t even remember. I was somewhere in the middle of the first staircase. and without any premises I felt I was dying.\nI experienced a tunnel vision , I felt I was isolated from the world, My heart started beating so fast for no reason, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel normal at all. I was shocked to the point I could barely breath, I was lucky that the stairs had a handrail I can hold onto, I slowly made my way to the building\u0026rsquo;s entrance, where some seniors noticed there is something wrong with me, I\u0026rsquo;ve asked them to bring me water and mango juice (Maza) for some reason, maybe I thought it was a sugar problem. I was carried to what I think was the network admins office or something similar where I rested but my heart couldn\u0026rsquo;t slow down. Thankfully a girl from my batch called Esraa saw me and stood stayed with me stood by since,\nI was taken to the hospital, where they put all those sensors to my chest and ran different scans and tests. After about half an hour of that relentless, heavy heartbeat, my heart finally slowed down. I expected nothing less than a stroke or some kind of heart condition. I even had this dramatic thoughts that I might die from heartbreak for reasons I had woven in my head. I thought, This must be it.\nSurprisingly, all the scans were clean. I remember the doctor telling me my heart was “like a horse’s heart,” and that I didn’t have any heart disease. Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the horse\u0026rsquo;s heart analogy I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less, but It was a relief, although I was too mentally overwhelmed to process anything. I never followed up with the doctors to understand exactly what happened. My family arrived and took me home. My sister Zeinab, who is a doctor, told me it was a panic attack and explained what that meant. I watched some videos about it including this TEDx video I remember clearly, and I immediately related to it. I also joined online support groups and found comfort in hearing other people’s stories.\nI was healing from this accident by listening to the stories of people who experienced the same thing. Knowing that others had gone through similar circumstances that I wasn’t alone was reasonable to me to relief. But I never looked into why I was triggered in the first other than knowing “stress can lead you here, and it will reoccur when you trigger it again.”\nI eventually noticed a pattern: I felt discomfort whenever I was at the university. I remember this day very distinctly where I wanted any excuse not to go there. And luckily for me, the car I used to drive had almost no gas, and I wasn’t planning to stand in a long fuel queue. For but for some reason, though, I decided to go using public transportation, first a city train, then a bus. While crossing the bridge, Kobry Alhadeed, I started getting anxious. I felt afraid. And the closer I got to the university, the more scared I became. I can’t remember the lectures from that day, but it was the day I confirmed the pattern.\nWhat shocked me was what happened after the lectures. A friend told me he wanted to pick something up from the Computer Science department building and asked me to walk with him before we return back home.I found myself standing in front of the entrance, and my stress levels were extreme. I couldn’t enter the building. That’s when I knew: this was the thing I feared. I was afraid that if I entered that building again, something would happen to me.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the building is officially the “CS Department,” but it’s mostly used for IT lectures. Since I’m a computer science student, I was never required to be there, I had no courses inside that building. But I used to go there anyway because many of our friends had lectures there and were always hanging out. What I didn’t realize is that I had been avoiding it the entire time without noticing. I didn’t enter that building again until the course finished.\nWriting this now triggered me a bit. It seems that building really freak me out the most. While I was fighting these internal battles with panic attacks, the symptoms started to manifest as IBS. I thought it was genetic, most of my family has it, but my sister told me mine was caused by stress, and because you were very stressed recently, the IBS decided to accompany you. And she was right, the conversations I had with Kenyata about pausing the grind, was because a very subtle, inner voice was whispering to me, you need to take rest, but because I was exploring and the dopamine was always high, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t notice that I was under stress, stress that I love doing, stress out of things I loved, I later learned that even the things you love can make you sick, but it was too late. I noticed I only experienced the symptoms when I was stressed, not when I ate garbage food.\nDuring that period, a sudden shift hit my social life, it changed suddenly. I couldn’t hold conversations longer than a minute. I avoided people, especially the ones I knew well. I felt that if I talked too much, I would die. And I mean that literally, that’s how it felt. Talking to people I knew became the scariest thing ever. Almost everyone in my batch noticed. “Ahmed has changed.” Some even sat with me and asked what was going on. I’m not sure what I told them, but I’m sure I said something like, “everything is fine”, because I had no words to describe what I was going through.\nAnd suddenly, I had social anxiety. Me? Ahmed? the guy who initiated our batch group chat, who was nominated to be the batch representative, who used to be public and comfortable speaking. I wasn’t afraid of people. And now I had social anxiety? It was hard to believe. It was a dramatic shift. My online friend the one I used to make fun of when he told me he had social anxiety, I was slowly beginning to understand him, and to understand how ignorant I had been. I never imagined a day would come when my thoughts would no longer control my body.\nI was skeptical. I made several assumptions to explain what I was experiencing. The first was returning to the idea that I actually had a heart disease, because all the discomfort was happening in my chest and around my heart. The second was that I might be bewitched or cursed somehow. And the third was that it was a punishment from God, because I had once thought my friend was exaggerating his condition, and making things up. Between those assumptions, I was lost. I genuinely didn’t know what was happening to me.\nA new fear was unlocked during that time. where I went to picnic and I met some friends some of them for the first time, it is common in Sudan, we greeted each other with hugs, before handshakes. I remember seeing the first group of friends, and before we even hugged, my body was signaling that I should run, that I shouldn’t let anyone touch me. I\u0026rsquo;m someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like physical interactions, but not to the point of being terrified of it. I didn’t want this. I forced myself to hug them “normally”, and of course I didn’t die, but my stress levels was even higher than when I stood in front of the CS department building. At that moment, I believed for sure that I was bewitched. There was no way, that someone can get stressed and feel like they might die from hugging a friend, someone I should have been happy to see.\nAfter about two hours, another group of friends arrived, and when it came time for the hugging thing again, I partially fainted and fell to the ground. My friend Mustafa sensed my heartbeat; it was beating to the max. I don’t remember the exact dialogue, but they gave me something to drink and eat. And then I was fine again. They were confused because my explanations weren\u0026rsquo;t clear; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear to me either.\nI don’t remember a lot from that period because too many things were happening at once. But I do remember that after that picnic, I stopped meeting people entirely. I skipped university for several days. And it wasn’t long after that when the war started. To this day, I still can’t fully understand why all of this happened. But at least I evaluated my assumptions: I have came to the realization I wasn’t bewitched. After about eight months, I went back to working out and running, and being able to do those things easily, without any heart issues, boosted my confidence that I didn’t have a heart disease.\nI was gradually disappearing from people\u0026rsquo;s life, I had no motivation to talk to people, I have more things that are telling me not to connect with people, I mean if just hugs are doing this to do. lol, Looking back, I see many people who have no explanation for why I disappeared from their lives, why my behavior changed so drastically. Things weren’t good even before the war they were getting worse, but at least they eventually led me to understand that stress was the cause, even when I couldn’t feel the stress itself. One of the strange, almost funny stories from that time: several weeks after the incident, the right side of my face became completely paralyzed. I couldn’t move it at all. I went to the hospital, they diagnosed me with Bell’s palsy , a condition where the facial nerve on one side of the face suddenly stops working. And of course I was bewitched, of all the diseases that I know, I was given a weird paralysis in the face, someone must have wanted to torture me. After reading more about it, I learned that stress can also cause it. I rested my heart by saying, Stress is the cause.\nI remember I landed an internship but only went onsite for a total of three days. I remember barely speaking to my best friends during that entire period. I don’t remember much about how things were at home either, but I’m sure I kept myself constantly busy. Those days affected almost every part of my life. I tend to have a weaker memory for the bad times, but what I’ve written here are the extremes, the moments I simply couldn’t forget. The belief that I always had control over my mind and my body, that I can act as a commander was a heaven that I only realized when I lost control, when my mind and body turned against me. I was afraid that people would see me as vulnerable, I was afraid that with all this stress adding more and more complexity to my life, that I would be dependent on someone, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be burden. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to know that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ok.\n","title":"Days That I Don’t Understand","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/days_that_i_didnt_understand/"},{"content":"The velocity at which I\u0026rsquo;m updating my beliefs about the world has never been known to be slow; saying \u0026ldquo;Oops\u0026rdquo; and updating my beliefs implies updating my behavior if needed.

I doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much.\nSean, Good Will Hunting (Park Bench Scene)\nAlthough my previous blog post was expected to be an explanation of what I assumed to be something I adopted a long time ago and never updated before:\nbut I have never revised the list since a while\nAdding new friends system I never expected the system to be perfect, or that I was doing what is ultimately right. The reason why I felt I should be listing this legacy system of adding new friends by writing the blog post , is because I felt it was the time to rethink it. I wasn’t explicit about this, (meaning it took me time to realize that I really need to rethink it.), but I felt this shouldn’t continue. The case analysis is not as good as it used to be in helping classifying people, many cases violated the rules, but the system still pulls me back to use its methods. [!IMPORTANT] I will be using the terms system and legacy system interchangeably. The term legacy system refers to an outdated but still functional computer system, software, or hardware that continues to be used because it performs its original, essential tasks, even as newer technologies emerge.\n[!NOTE] I deliberately selected the term value when saying assigning the name “Friend”, because it is not just a word, I consider it a value. Calling you a friend adds the values that require me to “allow myself to fall, to invest my emotions.”\nby this elboration I hope to clear the misconceptions that might accure from my previous writing, it build on top of the previous blog post Adding new friends system , you might want to take a look if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. this conversation will particularly discuss the cases where the system is not good enough, why I was still using it?, how it is so bad to the people who should be friends.\nWhy so many rules? Life is meant to be simple. There are many levels to look into why I don’t actually find it hard to rank people.one is Checklist based thinking happens everywhere, by everyone. First impressions are a sort of ranking system, and most people don’t take any effort in check listing their candidates, because it happens in the background of their minds, embedded just like first impressions.\nThe same happens to me, except that I might be using more rigorous tests. So I’m not really adding logic to the equation of life, it’s already there.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m not really walking around ranking people according to my checklist of what I favor, it is my mind that blocks me from transcending a relationship beyond what it is, unless it satisfies what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. this can act as a reason for why I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so urgent about changing it, because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really suffering from it, it is something that happens almost naturally.\nAll the cool friends I could’ve made When establishing relationships, it is almost always the case that I don\u0026rsquo;t assign the value friend to them easily, lets call these people \u0026ldquo;candidates\u0026rdquo;, The best scenario is to have candidates who don’t care whether I gave this title to them or not; they don’t even ask about it. They see that I’m doing my best to match their energy.\nbut you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should\nAdding new friends system We’re supposed to enjoy the relationship without hindrance. I would do a great job at this, they would know I’m someone who never minds spending quality time with them, that I respect them, and am always happy to see them. Until they start to investigate their role within me too early.\nAnd if this happens, they won’t like it. They’ll translate me not adding them to the “friends” list as being heartless, as though they’re the ones taking part in the relationship, not me.\nI’d love if the universe worked according to my rules: why care about titles when I’m already there for you? But in the end, it’s not their fault. I shouldn’t have adopted this system in the first place, let alone explaining its creepiness to people or expecting them to understand it.\nHandling the misconceptions about “I will magically force myself to never invest emotions in the relationship” will take part shortly in this post, but for now, remember that the legacy system seemed to work for what I wanted it to do.\nhowever it does a greater job preventing “bad friends“. It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends) and this is where it helps me the most.\nAdding new friends system As long as it helps me make friends, and provides the definitions and rules of human interaction to me, I have no problem using it. But the real question is: why am I still using this legacy system?\nElaborating on the effects but there are downsides you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself.\nAdding new friends system Yes, I control the amount of love I stream toward someone/candidate, even if they were perfect candidates. I won’t send them any signals that strengthen our bond. I’ll avoid them. I’ll do what it takes to not invest emotion, and I’m good at it.\nI only stream what I think is sufficient to match their energy. The real downside is when this loop continues. They feel the walls I’m building hindering the relationship, and at that particular point I get disturbed.\nAt this stage, the best scenario is to respect the walls and plan to tear them down over time (though sometimes they’re never meant to be broken).\n1. Leakage in the system. In theory, I get to decide that I will not invest emotions, by controlling the amount of lets say love I stream for someone (love implies trust), just as computational theories ignore practical constraints, but in practice, emotions are not precisely controlled; they leak easily\n2. a double-edged sword. it is very common that I lose potential good friends in the process, and that hurts, seeing cool people leave. they realize how hard it is to deal with me, and then stop trying.\nThis cycle of people showing genuine interest in me, then suddenly losing it, is hard. It happened when I wasn’t aware that I had so many walls, that people aren’t good at climbing them. I was ignorant, selfish, not giving guidance on how to approach me.\nThinking it’s your thing to figure me out, who did I think I was? King Richard the Fifth? May I never trust my judgment again.\n3. But I\u0026rsquo;m hurt 2. What once felt unbearable to remember now feels necessary to recall. This one almost slipped out of memory, but when I lost those potential cool “friends,” I wasn’t happy about it. I remember now that I didn’t like it at all.\nI felt destined to live alone, not knowing I was drowning by my own design. I was too young to realize this. And instead of revising the list of rules I set to add new friends, to make them less rigorous, I fed it even more.\nWhy the legacy system is still in production Besides the system doing its job, there were boosters that helped keep it running.\nLet go before they let go:\nThe cycle of people entering and leaving my life left a scar. I started letting go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself caused these bad experiences to accumulate. It taught me that people leave, so I began preemptively leaving first.\n“People will stop trying to know you, you piece of shit. You’re setting the walls so high they won’t even try to climb them.” telling myself. And I had no idea that it was me causing this. That’s how two insecurities start boosting each other.\nThe legacy system is not helping me establishing new friendships (pending status cases). People are letting go of me because of this embedded legacy system. I let go of people before they let go of me. The legacy system itself helps me in the process of letting go of the people The legacy system says \u0026ldquo;Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re anxious that they might leave you. I can help you to get rid of them preemptively.\u0026rdquo; The system rewards me by \u0026ldquo;either way, they might have been bad friends or they didn\u0026rsquo;t pass the tests\u0026rdquo;. man screw the tests.\nin short this monster was feeding itself. and apparently me.\nIrresistible features:\nMy sister once made an observation during a family discussion about our dark past selves. She noticed that growing up (me), I had access to the bad world, with tons of potential bad friends I could’ve made, but I chose not to.\nThe system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, actual true negatives, the ones that really would’ve hurt me. The problem is, it also keeps making false positives: rejecting people who were good, who could’ve stayed. It convinces me that losing them was just self protection,Though it’s hard to take the burden of \u0026ldquo;controlling the stream of love towards someone\u0026rdquo;, it’s also hard to be stabbed in the back. The system has been doing a great job protecting me from harmful relationships, There was no other way, it was either being armed with it or being naïve and cut by friends.\nI’m good at keeping myself busy:\nThe legacy system not only controls how much love I give to people, it controls how many people I give it to.\nThose I call friends rarely exceed five or ten. I keep myself busy, which limits how many interactions I can manage. I’ve learned I don’t need to make a friend in every new country or city I live in, not doing so doesn’t kill me.\nI manage the few friends I have very well. They give me more than enough. I don’t plan to have many friends, it’s not aligned with my social energy or resources. The legacy system is good at controlling that number. It’s a win-win.\nAnswers not found elsewhere:\nSometimes I think about dismantling the system and moving on, but questions arise:\nHow do I prevent wounds if I step outside my walls?\nHow do I define friendship as something prestigious and not instantly given?\nThe first fence in the system is crucial, it helps control the number of people in my life. I can’t be friends with everyone I meet; I’d end up with too many.\nQuestions the legacy system fails to answer Some questions the system simply can’t answer well:\nWhat should I do if they figure it out?\nPeople go through painful ups and downs during the “pending” phase. They lose meaning in establishing a relationship once they realize they’re not assigned a value yet.\nI wasn’t trained to trust people this fast, but it’s not right to keep them hanging. The system doesn’t guide me here: should I explain it? Should I force myself to love them or assign the value they deserve?\nWhat should I do with pending requests?\nSome people are never meant to enter, I prefer keeping walls between us. The system doesn’t provide guidance.\nI remember a friend, culturally a friend, but I never really invested in him. He was great, but I didn’t want to allow myself to fall into that bond. Poor him, what did he have to do with my hormones? Again, the system didn’t help.\n404 Not Found:\nSometimes I fail to migrate relationships outside the scope of the greater good , that shared purpose that once connected us.\nI meet cool people in cool places; we like each other. But once the shared context is gone, I can’t find a new reason to stay connected.\nOutside the greater good:\nSome people are great under the scope of a project or purpose, but outside it, I can’t find what links us. Their attempts get pended.\nUndefined “something”:\nothertimes its more specific cases, For example, someone once part of my team, ideally female, wanted to get to know me outside of that shared goal. “Female friend”? I have no definition for that. How should I act? I don’t know, but I’ll definitely run away from anything undefined, lol.\nIf this isn’t your case, good for you. Some people don’t suffer from basic questions like deciding whether to make someone a friend or not. But I do, not enough to urgently change, but enough to notice it.\nI can still approach people, create one sided friendships, get what I need, make them smile, make them do what I want gently, wish them well, and support their wins.\nMost importantly, I can keep myself busy enough to avoid looking too closely at my malfunctioning legacy system.\ntoday! I’ve unlocked a hidden insecurity that’s been operating subconsciously, one I partly knew existed but never realized how much it was feeding other insecurities.\nThis moment of self-awareness feels like progress. I just need to unlearn it now. It might take years, but I’ve begun.\n","title":"Elaborate: Adding New Friends System","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/elaborate_on_adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"I get asked:\nHow do you deal with ordinary people? The ones that don\u0026rsquo;t bother you? and when does it start that they enter your life?\nThis question has got me thinking. I recalled that checklist (set of rules) I have for making new friends, but I have never revised the list for a while. I have seen cases where people just hack the system, and suddenly they are knocking on the door of my heart before even check-listing half of it.\nThe set of rules I have adapted is simple enough to help me make new friends; however, it does a greater job preventing “bad friends.” It makes sure I can still enjoy life and have good healthy relationships (without the need to call them friends), and this is where it helps me the most. More about it later; first, let’s get to see where this starts.\nIn elementary school, I made the observation that most people around me complain about how they were betrayed, stabbed in the back, or any sort of resentment that happened to them, caused by relationships, particularly friendships. To make sense of why they suffer, my observation was: “All these people you were hurt by, you had positive feelings about them; you loved them.\u0026quot; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be in such a position, so I learned through preaching to myself.\nthe equation was obvious to me: \u0026ldquo;the more emotions I invest in someone, the deeper the wound is,\u0026rdquo; and you start investing emotions in people the moment you assign them the name \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; in your head. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall this equation resulting in me being afraid of making friendships, but what I did was to learn from them. What I learned is that many cases were wounded because they were too early in assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the people they met.\nAs social creatures, we tend to make friendships in the new places or paths we take (new school, new university, new habit…) or sometimes when we feel lonely, or even worse, when we are too optimistic. However, these reasons do not respect the slow pace needed for making friendships; they are in a rush. For example, a fresher might feel either very overwhelmed by the number of questions they got, so they try to establish friendships (either to feel no guilt if people also turn out not to have answers, or to have answers), or very energized by the amount of sudden freedom they were never granted before, and they want to make friends to do all sorts of crazy things they want to do. So whether your reasons were noble (work on study groups, research, projects, politics) or less impactful (host parties, go to the park), they are all tagged with urgency. Of course, you can\u0026rsquo;t wait two years to make a friend.\nFor these very reasons, \u0026ldquo;bad friends\u0026rdquo; happen, that we needed to call someone a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; we had tons of emotions that couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold their horses and needed someone to run for.\nHow I planned to overcome this? Simply don\u0026rsquo;t call people your \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; I haven’t used that term for as long as I can remember. My very first friend, I was telling myself about \u0026ldquo;Wow, this guy has done so much for me. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to call him a friend, then I\u0026rsquo;m selfish and heartless\u0026rdquo;. What people don\u0026rsquo;t understand is that I still had a quality time with that guy without calling him a friend. I was enjoying my life with them, and I was making memories.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve applied what happened with the first person I ever admitted by heart as a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to the friends I met down the road, is to never call them friends until time passes and they prove they are trustworthy.\nIf you keep saying everyone is your friend, you will end up wounded alot.\nBut there are downsides, you might say, and yes, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to fully open yourself. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you are going to be in defense mode all the time (or it is not that bad; maybe you will get used to it), but you will gradually match the energy of your candidates and make most of the time just as you should. But don\u0026rsquo;t call them friends, not yet, because the moment you start assigning them the value \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; you allow yourself to invest more emotions (trust, love, loyalty…). If you have an argument saying friendship should not be that hard, and at the start I don\u0026rsquo;t really allow myself to fall completely, then this is good for you, but for me, no. Assigning the value \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to people means a lot more, so I don\u0026rsquo;t give it away that easily. Luckily, society gave us names as placeholders for people that even can help define the interactions and limits of relationships to have with people: there are Coworkers, Neighbors, Classmates, Colleagues, Managers, Team members, Collaborators, Customers, Clients, Students, Teachers, and even Mutuals (your friend\u0026rsquo;s friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be your friend). Why don\u0026rsquo;t people use these? They are good, they protect you, they help you.\nGoing back to our discussion, the reason why I want to revise my set of rules for making new friends as mentioned before is that there seem to be people who violate the rules. They are just cool enough to make friendships with; they can\u0026rsquo;t stay just \u0026ldquo;people,\u0026rdquo; they need to be \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; And they already have the same amount of admiration as my friends, but I\u0026rsquo;m yet to call them \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; This nonsense happens for a lot of reasons; let\u0026rsquo;s list some:\nThe experiences I went through in making friends were very long in terms of duration, and this is purely by chance. My very first friends took a long time to call them friends — years. This was reflected in some way in my subsequent experiences (I started to consider taking more time just as how my first friendships took more time to bond). This might be nonsense, but that means even if someone passed the checklist in under six months, and they were finally qualified to be \u0026ldquo;friends,\u0026rdquo; without a year or two passing by, I can\u0026rsquo;t call them friends.\nIn simple terms, the way I formed friendship was that I get to know people very slowly and we disappear for years in the middle. This reflected that I don\u0026rsquo;t make people friends easily.\nAnother reason is to be mindful of the greater good we are serving. This is very common in relationships of University and Work because there is often a greater purpose that must be served and is compromised the moment we call ourselves \u0026ldquo;friends.\u0026rdquo; A good example would be a woman called Samar Yahia. Samar ages me by about ten years. We were co-founders of a startup at some point, and we just met. I never knew who she was, she knew who I am, and we never met to this very day although we live in the same city. Why? Simply because we prioritize the greater good of the startup by being co-founders/co-workers. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a great time; we had amazing conversations, laughter, we shared experiences and life lessons, we allowed ourselves to enjoy the process, and never made it boring. But let\u0026rsquo;s just not take it to the next level of being friends even if it feels right. If I ever get the chance to meet Samar in an alternative world, we would have been great friends, or if we had something other than work.\nThe last one is that I want to protect either myself or someone by not going to be a \u0026ldquo;friend,\u0026rdquo; and it is better to have walls between. An example would be: Ahmed is a cool new freshman at the university, and I want to take him under my wings by making friendship with him, aka investing emotions. But I might not do that. Although he passed the checklist and is now a good candidate, I might prefer to keep the default relationship (colleague) assigned to him. Why? Well, since he is too young, I’m not sure if by this sudden access to all sorts of amusement and ideologies, he will remain the one I hoped to make friendship with. This way I can protect myself from making friendships with Ahmed. Another pattern that happens a lot, is the other way around: University colleagues try to get to know me outside the University, and they are often pushed by walls I build to protect them from me. I don’t want them to invest their emotions in me because I don’t see myself as trustworthy, that I\u0026rsquo;m not someone they can really rely on, and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust myself to handle that responsibility, at least not yet. This way, I protect them (and many times hurt them) using the walls I build and keeping them away from my friends zone, and most importantly, keep myself away from their friends zone.\nAt the end, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just a traumatized kid formalizing all these rules to make friendship. In reality, I don\u0026rsquo;t really suffer from this. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m good at reaching out to people and making friendships. I don\u0026rsquo;t struggle to communicate with people or get what I want. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a bad time searching for quality time. And thinking about how much worse it could be without these rules, I remind myself to be grateful.\nWhat kind of walls do you mean exactly?\nThe first one, I assume, is to act ordinary (which is a product of the walls but it\u0026rsquo;s just the first fence), acting ordinary is to not reveal the basic information about me, my name, my age, what I do in life. But this layer is fragile, once I\u0026rsquo;m asked, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind answering, it helps me save time and avoid making unnecessary relationships, I can\u0026rsquo;t count the amount of cool and bad people I could have made in life if I had never had this first wall which I now call the fence (it assumes acting dumb while knowing, being nonchalant while I\u0026rsquo;m a bit interested(this one started to fading recently I gotta get my shit together), sharing misguided information about me).\nThe most important wall is the privacy wall. I only allow a certain amount of information to get leaked from what I\u0026rsquo;m doing in my life. What I want to do. I\u0026rsquo;m not giving or sharing what violates my privacy. this includes (my family, my moves, my trips, my quality time, my free time, my friends, my performance, my upside-downs)\nless in height, subtle insecurities I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to involve people in.\n","title":"Adding new friends system","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/adding_new_friends_system/"},{"content":"To nerd out and talk about a particular topic that you are deeply interested in/ obsessed with, requires you to unveil part of yourself. Your personality, your affection, your love for that topic. Often, it feels like dancing in the symphony of that subject(my analogy is very consumed, but I feel it holds true here).\nWhile jumping between discussions on Substack , I found myself watching this Kurt Vonnegut lecture.\nWatch the lecture Although I enjoyed the whole presentation, I was most impressed by his performance in the final minutes, the way he left the stage, his funny moves and gestures. This wasn’t unique to the ending, though. The way he spoke and carried himself throughout the lecture was “unique.”\nUnique to him.\nIt felt like this was how his soul interpreted information or felt about it, how it reacted to the joy of sharing his inner reasoning and experiences. You could sense the years of thought and accumulation behind every word. The jokes, the gestures, the rhythm, they were all expressions of his love for what he was saying.\nI found myself imagining a kind of paradise around the idea that he was never ashamed of being himself. Because when you look at him, he was doing weird stuff, awkward moves, overly specific jokes, yet the audience loved it. They understood and accepted his (uniqueness soon will be called awkwardness). They even craved it.\nuniqueness is just him being true to himself, acting natural and manifesting what he feels in the way he likes\nif this uniqueness exists in an alternative world, a world where he couldn’t be himself freely, where his natural self would be judged as strange akward. where his uniqueness is akwardness.\nWatching him leave the stage while everyone clapped, appreciating what he had shared, reminded me of how many intellectuals from my country travel abroad to pursue their careers in the United States or other Western nations that seem to value what they can offer.\noften saying,\nMy skills were welcomed in the country of Uncle Sam.\nThis isn’t about how the United States has built the perfect habitats for nerds and anyone who wants to be themselves; by embracing people as they are and shaping social norms around tolerance, rather than judgment.\nIt’s more about how bad I feel coming from regions where being your true self is misunderstood, misused, and simpy is a crime.\nAt that particular moment, watching him leave the stage, I remembered how unlucky we are for not growing up in environments that encourage us to nerd out, to share the things we are obsessed with in our own way, or even to share them at all.\nYou don’t know how many times I’ve tried to have deep discussions with people who are truly good at something(they are nerds about particular subject), just to crack through their insecurities and show them:\n“I’m a good listener. I won’t judge. Only love. I won’t be freaked out by your awkwardness. I’m more interested in hearing you express your passion naturally, not formally or shyly. You know you’re obsessed with it deep down — and there’s no reason to feel guilty about that with me.”\nCracking those defense walls is never easy.\nAnd it’s not their fault.\nIt’s the world they were born into, one that never prioritized who they truly are.\n","title":"Where You Are Allowed To Be You","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/where_you_are_allowed_to_be_you/"},{"content":"When making decisions in life, especially when we are faced with selecting between two events, we find ourselves comparing how important they are in order to determine which event we should choose. Some people study the implications of each decision and measure how rewarding or penalizing the outcomes might be. Picking the least penalty is a tactic for choosing a decision under this scenario.\nI first encountered this three years ago in one of Jeff Bezos’s interviews. he called it the Regret Minimization Framework. This tactic can be used on a smaller scale, even in daily decisions like getting out of bed or not. I’m sure you’ve used this tactic today in your own decision making process as a kind of mental tool. Usually, it helps me clarify priorities and take action with confidence. But what I’m here to share is a funny story: for the very first time, I was unable to use this utility in my decision making process.\nTwo events were taking place in the same hour block the next morning (8:00 AM). To make a decision, I defaulted my brain to use the regret minimization method. Unfortunately, the two events were equally likely in their consequences, at least from what my mind could list. Of course, life can have consequences that shows the advantages of one selection over the another, but I’m yet to know this and I need to make decisions under what I only know, and able to consider at the particular time I’m given this.\nIt felt exactly like how mathematical reasoning falls apart when dividing by zero, or how classical physics fails to explain things at small scales. This dilemma, of having two equally important events with either equally likely outcomes or vague consequences, made the regret minimization method fail completely. And honestly, that was a funny realization, because I’m rarely hesitant in making decisions. I know exactly what if I want to make a decision over another.\nMaybe I expected too much from this method,or misused it,but that’s not really the point I want to highlight. Perhaps this reflection doesn’t offer a grand piece of wisdom, but you can still take something from it: explore new ways of making decisions in your own life. Experiment with frameworks or tactics that help you choose the optimal option more often. And most importantly, pick an option, don’t stay up until (3:42 AM) like me, still undecided and unable to sleep.\n","title":"The Limits of the Regret Minimization Framework","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_limits_of_the_regret_minimization_framework/"},{"content":" Everyone is atheist until the plane starts falling. I have no clue who said this.\nThe numerous different stories that act as catalysts for returning to God and thinking about the existence of a grand designer or creator, shared by people across the globe, are interesting. There are a variety of patterns, and often the most interesting ones are those concluded through epistemic rationality rather than convenience or bias—where there was evidence that God existed, for them. One pattern is how God existed in everyday life. A good example is the historical belief that the creation of all temples and religions around the world throughout history is an innate, lowkey, subtle need for God.\nAnd this is what I’m interested in pulling strings from and building upon—what I felt right before I sleep. I’m not diving into theology, but rather sharing a concept I just coined: “Gratitude Register.” This is what I assume as the “where I find God” in my “everyday life pattern.” No matter what beliefs I’m holding or how religious or spiritual I am at a particular point in time, at the end of the day (literally) I find myself accounting for what was good today and in my life. This happens by default; it’s the way your psyche validates the day, your memory works, and you yourself try to make sense of all the nonsense you were doing throughout the day. Depending on how I define good (which of course includes biased beliefs or definitions from religion), I can bring different combinations of them. Now, if these things outweigh the misfortunes I have, that means it is a good day (again, there is no agreed upon way of defining and measuring misfortunes). Hence, some positive feelings may start to appear—one that stands out so loudly is gratitude. This feeling is a well known visitor, outshining others through its powerful urge.\nGratitude: “I’m here.” Translation: I’m grateful. Gratitude: “I need to make a decision so fast (urge).” Translation: I need to be grateful “for someone.”\nTranslation is what the mind tells about the chemicals.\nThis urge—and the small space I get to make the decision to fill it with someone—is what makes gratitude such a special “positive feeling.” This is how I translate it as a way to know God, and I’m feeling it every day. To know this Gratitude Register (just like how a CPU register is filled quickly and needs to assign the value to some process) requires some form of mental allocation.\nIf it happens and if I’m a full time atheist (I don’t wish that for anyone) I believe this interaction, of validating my day and unconsciously inviting “gratitude” as a result of just being human, shall rescue me from muddle and may guide me toward the light.\nThis is a piece of my honest and truthful analysis of my feelings toward gratitude.\n","title":"Gratitude Register","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/gratitude_register/"},{"content":" do things badly\nAs the years pass by, I find myself adapting to different reasons to keep living, and to share, I\u0026rsquo;m not as clear as I used to be about why I should be posting something publicly, but looking back over the years, I recall how writing started. How reasons changed.\nThe Seeds of Writing I\u0026rsquo;ve had amazing language teachers (Tahia and Jamal), who encouraged me to write and read since I was a little I\u0026rsquo;ve been under the wings of people who are naturally good at writing (this probably influenced me, I mean, I used to write poetry when I was a little) I felt the need to express my feelings through writing (I\u0026rsquo;ve been actively journaling since 8th grade) I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen in love with quotes and I became a collector at some point, they seemed to explain the world, so I started crafting my own through writing (High school/teenager period) I\u0026rsquo;ve wished people could write more about their experiences and not generic content When I needed someone to talk about Computer Science from their heart, experience, and not what they have studied Reem\u0026rsquo;s blog was my savior, and then later I loved the writings of Mohammed Yousif especially the self-reflection notes, and his feelings. I wanted to document my journey in life, I wished that the elderly people in my life had books/blogs that they had left behind for me, so I can get to know them more, even after they\u0026rsquo;re gone. I wanted to make sense of my doings, I would write the task I should be doing for myself to see if I understand the procedure that is supposed to happen, and if there are any subtle pitfalls in my understanding I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of. Yes, these are all different reasons, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how I\u0026rsquo;m going to organize them, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to overthink this.\nDemons but I got demons\u0026hellip;. that were holding me from writing.\nI get amazed by the number of clicks I write on the keyboard everyday writing something. and it is really fascinating how I barely share it publicly. I\u0026rsquo;m not in my best to recall the WHY behind why I\u0026rsquo;ve been skeptical about this, but below are what I can list now:\nBeing busy is the biggest factor for not sharing it publicly, not that I can\u0026rsquo;t press post/publish but that I have a cognitive overload from being busy, I get to experience and learn lesson on the fly which I assume its a bless. but it comes in huge numbers and sometimes hard to unpack what I\u0026rsquo;ve learn. so they time between me taking the lesson and preparing to share the lesson spans, if I assigned a name to this period, lets say C, there will even more lessons that will pop in that period which lead to me giving up completely on sharing.\nNot making sense of how this would help me. there was a time where I\u0026rsquo;ve had lost the meaning and I was blinded by something that I don\u0026rsquo;t know, the prevented me from seeing how this can help me in any way (practically speaking, yes I had reasons to write but not to share)? (later I found some reasons to share).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the writing tools: at that age being afraid is the default, I was telling myself if that x human is better than you at writing and knows how why would you still share? they got the experience, they got the talent, the got the time, they got the confidence. looking to back to how small I was to start such a thing makes sense.\nDo people call it a comfort zone?: I recall in 2023-2025 I stopped a number of my social media accounts repeatedly, until this very day, I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet posted one single status on my main WhatsApp account. And months can pass without sharing something publicly, now this has its own story, but it was one big reason that I\u0026rsquo;ve felt comfort in not being in public/ in not sharing, even if that is on social media.\nPrioritize what\u0026rsquo;s important: there is also a time when I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at the words that I\u0026rsquo;m writing, and that I should be sharing, but not to everyone, maybe I can do this to my closest people first, family, and friends. They deserve better, someone who is not being busy, but being responsive and collaborative. So throughout the last 2 years, I was investing more in my closest circle.\nDetails and setup: everyone has their own unique way of communicating, with mutual culture you get to say what you want smoothly (by smoothly I mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t face difficulties in deciding what to say and the recipient is not having trouble interpreting your words to what you actually meant) if we were to imagine how deviated I\u0026rsquo;m from that line, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not as close. maybe in reality I can relate and talk to people, but inside my head I overthink and over-engineer what I should say to the person in-front of me based on the data they are directly or indirectly steaming to me, will they relate to what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about, are they comfortable talking about this, are they going to feel offended, am I talking fast, and not showing them the point, did I match their energy/slang, was the conversation interactive?, dozens of questions, now image you are talking to over thousand person, thats what I put in my mind and heart before sharing anything publicly. Now these details are hard to overcome.\nI\u0026rsquo;m wasting my time here: this is a real demon here, it tells me that the time I would spend in writing and then responding to people\u0026rsquo;s comments, inquiries, friendships, rituals out of curiosity about me from my posts, can be dedicated to doing something more useful, I would spend more time doing more important things maybe.\nmoving forward This blog website is an attempt; it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be the last one, but I have faith in it.#\n","title":"Why I’m Sharing Notes","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-do-this/"},{"content":" Early to rise early to bed, makes a man healthy but socially dead\nOne thing that i\u0026rsquo;m sure about is, that I don\u0026rsquo;t miss people easily, not that I don\u0026rsquo;t bare people, or I\u0026rsquo;m antisocial. but I keep myself busy to the point I forget about the people, I feel sorry for myself and for the people I know that I\u0026rsquo;m emotionally inactive when I need it.

I\u0026rsquo;m not very visionary and dreamy, so I think about life directly, but here are some lessons that I learned.\nWhat you learn models the way you think. We try as much as possible to interpret the complexity of the world and answer the why and how behind things; the way we think and use our minds is completely different based on what we have learned, and dictates how we will view the world. If that\u0026rsquo;s chemistry, you will look at life as a chemical reaction, a mathematician viewing it as a melody of logic, a writer as stories, and so on.\nThe reality has nothing to do with your hope. Life is very unpredictable; you can\u0026rsquo;t say good things happen for good people, or I have put too much into this project hence it will succeed, life has nothing to do with your hope.\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t pursue happiness directly. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall when was the last time I heard someone asking whether you are happy or not, and how to be happy. It looks like everyone is suddenly not talking about happiness, which is good in my opinion. Happiness is something you pursue indirectly.\nhere comes the people. Unexpected Time Sink You respawned in this world hoping that you would spend most of the time doing what you love, but then you realized that a great portion of your time is dedicated to people, some of them whom you might like, and others you will force yourself to adapt wasting time with.\ncheerful face and sweet words You can get what you want with a cheerful face and sweet words: People hold positions, some of them control the valves of opportunities. What I found is, besides having the potential to fit the need, if you have reached out, cold emailed, or any sort of communication, people will help you make things out.\nPeople have feelings, I guess. They feel, every single action you do influences the way they look at you. If you never show up for their invitations, if you were a bit off that day, your tune changed. I fooled myself for a long time, thinking that people would never notice the small things that I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\nAbout me.

For instance,, if I live in the big city of Khartoum with a 9 - 5 job anda regular pace of life, I will never be able to generalize what people might suffer from and what challenges they face in different parts of Sudan. I just can\u0026rsquo;t.\nKeeping up, what is that? I\u0026rsquo;m the worst when it comes to keeping up with people and the news. In order to feel natural and get along with most of today\u0026rsquo;s youth and even adults, you need to have a middle ground to talk about, in most cases, football, politics, and news, which I don\u0026rsquo;t really bother myself to follow.

It feels unfair, it\u0026rsquo;s hypocrisy. either I shouldn’t appear friendly in the first place, or I should remain consistent with the way I start. which is being friendly forever.\nCRM when thinking about these problems, I found out I was not up to the promises I tell myself, although I want to check on people I love from time to time, I don\u0026rsquo;t do that, I just can\u0026rsquo;t maintain it, I fail every time, I recently came to the term, Customer Relation management where business people keep track of their customers, and found a video that talks about applying this idea into tracking your social life.\nWhen I thought about these problems, I realized I wasn’t living up to the promises I made to myself. Even though I want to check on the people I love from time to time, I just don’t do it. I just can’t maintain it; I fail every time. Recently, I came across the term Customer Relationship Management, where businesses keep track of their customers, and I found a video talking about applying the same idea to tracking your social life. where you keep track of customers and call when you, its just a system that companies use to remember their customers. I did my own version on Notion , where I listed names of people I care about the most, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too late until I forgot about it. All my attempts seem to fail.\n","title":"I Keep Failing the People I Care About","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/i_keep_failing_the_people_i_care_about/"},{"content":" I’m not sure if it exactly look as I imagine it\nZeinab\nThe first time I encountered this idea was when talking to Zeinab Sami 016 FMSI, while I insisted that she must study how stochastic processes are involved in machine learning, she responded with something that falls into the idea: “Your perception of this major might be different from reality.”\nIndirectly, she helped me to adapt this as a new way of thinking when picking majors throughout my life, whenever we plan to study something new we might have initial assumptions about it, its almost the case, that our minds are not null when we study new materials, we do not only take assumptions with us, but also attach information we hear along the road with it. with extra imagination.\nMost of us have heard the term quantum mechanics, and you probably have imagined the nature of how these types of studies are, no matter how far your assumptions are from true, say you have been hesitating to enter an engineering degree due to your imagination of previous engineering classes or things that you have learned that helped you to generalize to the engineering concept. I’m not the best at making analogies, but I will tell the story of stochastic processes and my conversation with Zainab. She’s a Computer Science major who devoted more time and effort to mathematics while also maintaining good grades in CS related subjects. She shared me the work of a mathematician in stochastic processes after winning a Nobel prize on his word, or Fields Medal I really can’t recall it. we were arguing about how he managed to imagine these things, let alone architecting a framework to explain it, Although we tried to “wonder” but we come from completely different backgrounds, as I see stochastic processes from practical Machine Learning point of view, mainly thinking of “if I never set a random seed I might never reproduce my same results again, my weights will always initialize randomly, the gradient will always give different results/trough when minimizing the cost function”, Zainab is coming from a completely different background thinking about the mathematics how differential equations are implemented…etc.\nThis idea of things being as you imagine them, or as the image you are able to craft by generalizing from previous experiences, is something I often think about.\nHow to benefit from this lesson. Assuming you want to study a material in a new subject that you have never studied before, you will have generalization ability to predict how it\u0026rsquo;s going to be, but the reality might be different. and sure it is different, from the things that you can think of, it is always better to do the process to know how things are. quantum mechanics seems like you will be imagining where the cat is, what will happen if I observe it, but in reality, you will be doing differential equations, which will shape the framework of how you think about these problems. So this might let you think twice that THINGS ARE NOT AS YOU IMAGINE them, don’t let your assumptions fool you.\nInstead, it should be a part of your learning process, when you hit the realization of what actually this topic is talking about, for a very long time, I thought calculus is about calculation, after reading it I knew that it was talking about the rates of changing, and now I view as the art of dealing with tight spaces, and I will keep changing my assumption about it as I go, or maybe adding to the previous once. so having this flexibility will always help.\n","title":"What you want to major in might not be exactly what you imagine it to be","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/what_you_want_to_major_in_might_not_be_exactly_how_you_imagine_it/"},{"content":"Lately, I lost my ability to focus and maintain a flow state. I don’t sleep late, I eat relatively healthy food, and I’m not dopamine addicted. The problem comes down to practices that would align your efforts with what you want to achieve.\nToday, and after 15 days of nonsensical hard work (definitely I learned, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t comfortable learning), I get an hour with myself, having a lovely flow state, I will note and try to list all the things that I have done to get my focus back. 1. Sleeping early (70%) The percentage here indicates the importance of the action and how it contributes to the focus during the day, sleeping early isn’t new to me, I noticed that not doing this step, will degrade my performance (mentally \u0026amp; physically) particularly mentally, the physical condition can be refreshed after 1:00 PM or in the middle of the day, but the mentally is ever lasting throughout the day. But doing this step alone (i.e, validating how just sleeping early can affect your focus/performance) is not highly rewarding; it’s more of a prevention than a boost, which prevents you from having a bad day/focus rather than boosting you with flow state.\n1. Waking up early(90%) Now this is the most important part, sleeping early is not enough, you need its complement, which is waking up early, whether you slept at 9:00 PM or 12:00 AM\nWaking up early always makes it better to concentrate.\n","title":"Flow State and Sleep","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/flow_state_and_sleep/"},{"content":"I once read:\n“one of the greatest tragedies in life is that you will always be loved more than you will ever know, someone in your class might find your presence inviting and warm even if you’ve exchanged a few words with them or maybe none at all, someone on the street loves your smile and it brightens their path for the next few blocks, someone who regularly comes to work is disappointed when you aren\u0026rsquo;t there, someone missed you today, someone noticed when you’re gone, someone loves you when you’re there, someone loves you when you’re nowhere to be found at all, you might think you have always disappeared when you’re no longer in the picture, but you never left the frame”\nAs far as I remember, this quote is the very reason I no longer question why people might feel my existence in their lives is adding value. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t project myself to if I were the “people”… do people help in my life indirectly, or without them knowing? Unlike my previous answers, which were showing independent personality and actions that didn’t need the “people” in their space. I found that sometimes people do change the way I think, talk, the frequency of doing something good, the latency of retrieving meaning from something, the hope and the discovery. Sometimes it’s crystal clear how I\u0026rsquo;m affected by their doings, other times it’s indirect; only their existence will bring every good part of me to life again.\nIt really sadness me that I was loved by many, more than I thought, I recently published a video, after a long time of me being distant, people went crazy sending to me and asking how I’m, and most of them notice that I was not around recently, I was fooling my mind that social life is not important, wether you are present or not, people will forget you, in short, it is hard to admit, but there are people out there who love us more that we know.\n","title":"The greatest tragedy in life","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the_greatest_tragedy_in_life/"},{"content":"It was a rainy day when I realized that I was 19 years old, and I only had a few months left to turn 20. I’m no longer becoming a teenager, just like how John Green puts it, my 20s will go fast. My 30s will go faster than I can imagine, and suddenly I’m 40.\nYou can’t let your mind stop thinking about the future or let the things from the past stop controlling you. I have experienced life and responsibilities, but surely the 20s will be different, and I tried to answer one question: what am I afraid of? Why I’m afraid of being 20: and it turns out it is not only one question,but I was filled with lots of questions:\nWhat do I want to do for the rest of my life? What do I want to keep? What do I want to quit? Who will I stay with? Which people would I leave? Will I be able to practice my hobbies as the time I need to make videos and pursue my cinematography projects? What would happen to the way I think? Will my beliefs keep helping me? Will I remain a robust young dreamer or a dull mechanic worker in this fast world? Will I ever be able to never forget what I wanted to achieve? Will I be able to go through the mud as I entered the 20? Will the opportunities come? Will the things I love remain the same? Would I remain settled even after experiencing my 20s? Will I be able to interpret the complexity of the world and answer these questions, or just be the silent man who never ever thinks beyond his responsibilities? Or I will just ignore all the questions, and say in everything and every time there will be a crack, and it\u0026rsquo;s where the light gets in. And I should never create competitions and challenges that don’t exist yet. I’m sure Allah swt will guide me in every step, and just focus on what matters and eventually everything will come, and keep believing that all the things that I have lost will find their way to me. And it will come back to me. I’m turning 20 next week. Here are some lessons I think I learned in my teens, I may change my mind about some of them in the future.\nYour family must be no.1 priority in your life. You must have one thing that your life revolves around(Religion, category of people). People are not good at understanding themselves. Being Busy can prevent you from doing stupid things, and at the same time from good things, make sure to balance. Sleep early and wake up early. Don’t create competitions that doesn’t exist, be realistic. You can explore life in your teens and 20s and be a generalist, but set a limit for that and try to specialize and focus on the important parts. Routine is the small steps you take towards every big goal you set for yourself. A good level of understanding yourself, is knowing what you are not good at. If you’re a junior and you think you are smarter than an old outdated seniors, think twice; they have experience. Someone may find your presence warm and lovely without you knowing, so always be kind. If people do like you and you don’t know why, try to know why and keep practicing this thing for the rest of your life. Memories are the most warm feeling in the world, and the time you’re remembering them, will always be a happy time. I guess Happening is something that you pursue indirectly. Pray to Allah for giving you a clear mind, and practice exercise, eliminate distractions and you will have super flow state. Our beliefs are changing every time and we probably notice that late. If you ever felt happy for no reason try to ask yourself why? Write it down and read it when you’re down. Being optimistic about something and putting massive emotions into it doesn’t mean it will succeed. Reality is just independent of your thoughts Sad, or in pain? This will always come back at some point; you gotta use the time you have when you’re at your best. You may hurt people without knowing that you did, so you need to make sure you apologize frequently and ask people about how you behave. Chasing one thing will make the other things run away, like chasing a job but your health is in danger. You can be good at anything, including research and engineering, without a university, but the university is still important. We are not alike in the way we receive new information and knowledge; some know how to extract every possible information out of it, while others don’t. Mainstream titles like “entrepreneurship” can wait, and people who are seeking it since early ages of their career or uni want only the money, but they don’t have the needed skills and capacity to be the one. You may be good at using one of the technologies that uses scientific methods, but till you should always be humble to that outdated professor who spends his life solving equations and teaching math that you see as useless. You just didn’t realize the importance of it yet and the impact he is having. Avoid blaming your family members ","title":"20","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/20/"},{"content":"One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on Facebook , not consistently, and then I went through what I called “ Manulasis ”(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.\nThis happened because of the overwhelming number of times I discarded posts, notes, videos, or images I intended to share. Eventually, I gave up and abandoned the whole idea, and in doing so, I vanished from reality. This hesitation wasn’t new to me; I’ve been repeating this pattern since childhood. I would have sudden peaks of exposing my thoughts to the world, followed by long troughs of detachment and isolation. The amount of life that happens during those troughs makes it difficult to say everything when I finally try to reconnect with the world again.\nIf I turn a blind eye to the complexity, one of the strongest incentives behind sharing my notes is the fear of regret . I have been running from this feeling most of my life. The idea that all the messages, reflections, and thoughts I discarded will haunt me in the future terrifies me. This fear is closely tied to the feeling of standing on the Day of Judgment, knowing I had something that might help someone, but I never shared it. Recording what I’ve learned is a way to pass something forward to future generations.\n","title":"Why Im Sharing Notes - Regret","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-im-sharing-notes-regret/"},{"content":" There\u0026rsquo;s an anecdote about Richard Feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on Mr Feynman desk and makes a comment about these being a record of Feynman\u0026rsquo;s thinking and then Mr Feynman corrects the historian and says that: these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you\u0026rsquo;re thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that\u0026rsquo;s when Mr Feynman says: no they aren\u0026rsquo;t a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.\nIf I were to say the most important feature of making my life interpretable, it would be writing. I make sense of what is changing in my life through my writing, publicly, I don’t mention exciplicitly what is changing, but instead I just write. mostly about my beliefs, what I value, and the challenge I’m facing at the time. I do it multiple times throughout the year, and just by comparison, I can tell what changed. This self-reflection can help me distinguish between actual growth and commitments I made due to bad experiences, whether I adopted sudo-nihilism to cope with misfortunes, or if my pace in learning is slow and the road is very steep. All sorts of learnings in my journey are coming from my writings.\nAround 2018, I and Abd Alwahab Were arguing about some existential questions as teenagers while walking along the train track in the borders of our little small town district of Al-Daroshab , I came up with the realization that all the people who have died, are unable in anyway to share the lessons they have learned, not even as single lesson. through any channel. I remember that I never stopped talking about that idea with him that day. Years later, after deepening my understanding of our religion, Islam, the importance and encouragement of knowledge sharing, and the intolerance of not sharing knowledge.\nAlthough the priority is sharing the Islamic teachings and standing beside what is right. But I found that sharing small, minor details of our lives might be valuable. Scarcity of information: I was lucky that I was provided with an abundance of resources and access to people whom I can ask questions. I was raised having a computer, a brother to guide me through the installation of translators and IDEs on my machine, although he only just told me the names, but I was born lucky to some extent. I couldn’t even comprehend the idea of thinking about how my life would have been without having access to all the people and information. What I learned as a child significantly influenced the person I have become today. I never had the chance to appreciate this. Until a later period of my life, when I noticed a pattern of how the availability of information can lead to different lives.\nIn my primary-schooling period, I was smarter than most kids in “Computer” lessons and labs. And the teachers always ask me the following questions\n“Where did you learn this from?” or “Does your father come from an IT background?” so there must be a source of information, as they are assuming there is a light that must have guided you. something that sparked the first interest. That has led you to the person you are today. The same question is being repeated to students who are excelling in math (I suck at math), and looking back after I investigate them, they also had some sort of access to information (private tutor, aspirations, someone recommended a book for them), and so on.\nA model to understand information sharing. During my last year in high school, I started to view the world as a big network of knowledge/information sharing. I teach you computer science subject(what I use to do) and Abdalrahman (Math nerd who used to teach us mathematics) no matter how you are good in one subject you will always need help from different people, who are either in the same specialization that you’re looking for help with, or something else, This result of this processing of sharing information is to facilitate lives.\nWhat is wisdom does it have something to do with Making life much easier: I remember taking a consultation from Ali Azam one day about what university to pick, he told me that the university you’re going to pick will determine your next five years if not having a contribution to your whole life. He guided me through how its not just the name and reputation of the university but also the city where you live and ..etc a very concise definition of wisdom that I developed is: better decision making.\nAs I see many people are thinking about wisdom that same way as knowledge and whenever they heard the world a wise man they imagine someone who’s moving around with 200 IQ and quote to say everywhere. They ignore the fact that a wise man not only knowing but make actions and decisions based on his information.\nIf you zoom into your lifespan you would find there is this one component of decision making that significantly influenced your life today/the person who you are.\nThese decision are sometimes big ; whether to continue education or not, sometimes small; should I read today or play, the word decision is not about just being prompt to select between 2 or multiple choices, but it’s what you’re doing everyday you’re unconsciously calculate if you are going to sleep early or not whether you want to skip your leg day or study… etc\nEvery decision matter, not making a choice is also a choice\nThings I feel sorry about: One of the things I felt would make my life so much easier is knowing how to do math. Throughout my schooling period, I never encountered a math teacher who encouraged me to love math or helped me to do it; they did the exact opposite, except for the statistics and probability experience. And no wonder I love statistics more.\nWhen I entered university, I had to deal with all the previous experiences that had affected me. The access to top-tier students helped me make better decisions based on what they have experienced from success, failures, for instance, my senior Zainab helped me significantly understand math structure, and that I lack prerequisites for some courses.\nThis information sharing resulted in making my life easier. Sure, the math I had to deal with wasn’t easy, but in the hope of making this decision of going back to prerequisites, no matter how hard it is, it made my life later easier.\nI have seen people who never stop talking, but I couldn’t mine any useful information that would facilitate my life, while with little chatting with the most introverted person in the room, I can get advice that I never had the chance to know about.\nI shared my experiences in multiple aspects of life, whether it\u0026rsquo;s something big like joining a computer science school or not, or minor like recommending a software.\nWhile I was scared people would make a decision based on my experience, I kept emphasizing the idea that they should use the information they obtained from me as a data point, not final words, and it\u0026rsquo;s based on my experience, I try as much as I can to be unbiased and to tell what matches their needs. sometimes I receive messages from people saying that the decision they made has led a successful results, AKA make their lives so much easier. which I found very fascinating. most people who can help with information will be hesitant to share it, and even the failure when sharing it can be used as a decision making by someone else; this is basically how our lives work.\nThe reason why I’m writing these articles is the hope that there is someone who will make use of them in one way, taking a single idea that would inshallah help make their life easier.\n","title":"Why I'm Sharing Notes — Learned Too Late","url":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why_im_sharing_notes/"},{"content":"Progress: One of the good things I lack in my life is receiving feedback. Usually, everyone assumes that I’m an expert at everything, and they tend to define the way of our communication based on my social presence (oh, that’s Ahmed, everyone likes this dude. he is amazing… etc) while the reality is significantly different. I know several quality skills, like anyone, without having superpowers, I know how to speak, communicate, but I guarantee you I’m not the best!, and there is alot that you don\u0026rsquo;t know about me.\nThe problem is the iconography that the presenters who lead conversations/first time meets tend to define me with! They overglorify my story and the person I am, and this is not serving me in any way. The smarter the presenter will present you, the more independent you are likely to become.\nAnd that was always the case: people treated me based on what they heard about me, and probably that was brighter in a way that blinded what they would hear from me later. All my attempts to correct that, are prone to failure.\nFeedbacks!
