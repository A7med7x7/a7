<p><em>I&rsquo;m starting to notice things I never saw before — or maybe I saw them, but I wasn’t paying attention. For some reason, everything has become a metaphor.</em><br>
— Davis Mitchell</p></blockquote>
<p>I have always loved poetry, as a child, I wrote my own poems with a strange seriousness for someone my age, I remember the joy, the quiet excitement, the almost sacred feeling of sharing them with my family, especially my brother Mohammed and my sister Zeinab. They were the novelists of our home. writers in the fullest sense. everyone in the family wrote in their own way, but Mohammed and Zeinab were different.I felt like writing was not something they visited; it was something they lived inside.</p></p>

<p>you&rsquo;re just forgetful.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is one attribute that almost all people around me do seem to know about, because I keep talking about it a lot; it&rsquo;s that I find it difficult to remember both people and places, I forget things very easily, I&rsquo;ve never investigated up until I was 18 why, why it was easy to forget moments, people and places looking back into my life trying to remember some of these moments when someone reminds me with, I see those large periods that are just black, like they were just wiped away from my memory, mostly void, sometimes they are on the edge, if I wasn&rsquo;t remembered by someone or something at that stage of my life I would have never remember them.</p></p>

                    <p><p>At the start of the year, I had to catch up with a team I’m part of. we wanted to escape the dull rhythm of formal meetings and genuinely check in on how everyone had lived through 2025.I asked a simple question:</p>
<p><strong>If you had to sum up your entire year in five words, what would they be?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed listening to everyone, some pretty interesting answers where there, until they flipped the table on me. I had two minutes. I had never truly reflected on the year before, so what came out surprised even me.</p>
<p>These were the five words.</p></p>

<p>I used to lament having no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was a kid, my elder brother Mohammed used to work in many 
<a href="https://takaful98.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charity organizations</a>
. I used to be part of many of the events these charities were about. I saw the suffering of kids who were at the same age as me, many of whom had no father, no mother, no home to return to. the suffering was everywhere, yet they managed to smile every now and then. these were perhaps the earlier times when I started comparing my suffering to those whose suffering was far greater than mine.</p></p>

                    <p><p>Today, I spent five hours talking to Awab.</p>
<p>It wasn’t planned. no intention, no emotional preparation. he texted me casually saying: <em>“VC in 2–3 hours?”</em> the kind of message you expect to lead to small updates and shallow catching up as we usually do. Instead, it became one of the most profound conversations I’ve ever had. this piece exists to serve as an act of gratitude toward Awab, a person I realized today I’ve never properly stopped to appreciate. this is how I process affection: by intellectualizing the feelings, by writing instead about it, instead of feeling it directly, lol. If so, It captures fragments of what I learned about friendship, about myself, and about what it means to be understood without asking to be.</p></p>
