                    <p><p>This question is by far the hardest for me to answer. I’ve tried for years, and every attempt was prone to failure. A big part of the struggle wasn’t just about identity itself, but about how strange my relationships were, unstable, confusing, always shifting. It’s hard to know who you are when the people around you

, for you to see your reflection in them.</p>
<p>This writing sums all my previous attempts in the search for who I am. I’ve been taking notes on what I believe about myself, the frameworks I adopted, and the ways I tried to describe the person I thought I was. What you’ll read here is a reflection and a summary of those notes, up to today.</p></p>

<p>There is one attribute that almost all people around me do seem to know about, because I keep talking about it a lot; it&rsquo;s that I find it difficult to remember both people and places, I forget things very easily, I&rsquo;ve never investigated up until I was 18 why, why it was easy to forget moments, people and places looking back into my life trying to remember some of these moments when someone reminds me with, I see those large periods that are just black, like they were just wiped away from my memory, mostly void, sometimes they are on the edge, if I wasn&rsquo;t remembered by someone or something at that stage of my life I would have never remember them.</p></p>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/abd.alwahab.alser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abd Alwahab</a>
 told me he had secured a scholarship in India and might travel to pursue it. After a lifelong friendship, growing up in the same district our entire lives, the time had finally come for him to leave for his undergraduate degree. I don’t recall thinking deeply about it at first, because it seemed that he hadn’t fully made up his mind yet. When I returned to Sudan, I got busy with university, and suddenly things became real on his side.</p></p>

                    <p><blockquote>
<p>There is a famous Viktor Frankl quote:<br>
<em>“When a man can’t find a deep sense of meaning, he distracts himself with pleasure.”</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Franks argues that the lack of meaning causes people to seek temporary relief in superficial pursuits, rather than addressing the underlying existential void. Perhaps for many, maybe even for most people, this is a big issue, but there is another group that suffers from the opposite problem. </p></p>

<p>It’s never simple to confront an insecurity you’ve never recognized before, to finally name something that has quietly shaped you for years. I’m not afraid to acknowledge it but I’m also not very comfortable exposing my vulnerabilities . Still, I believe that notes are a record of my thinking process, and for the sake of honesty, integrity, I can’t ignore the mistakes I’ve made or the impact they’ve had on others. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m, in relationships.</p></p>
