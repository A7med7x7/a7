        <p>The velocity at which I&rsquo;m updating my beliefs about the world has never been known to be slow; saying &ldquo;Oops&rdquo; and updating my beliefs implies updating my behavior if needed. This oscillating pattern of behavior has been defining the kind and amount of love I receive in this world, updating a behavior is either bringing me joy by interacting with people, loving myself, or appreciating the world, or has led me to a series of overwhelm led by the need to solve the questions I’m cornered with.</p>
<p>The cycle starts with me being very concerned with a question, which, once I compose and unveil what it is, I see that it will take a lot from me. It will take my attention, my joy, and ultimately the time with my loved ones. Although the downsides of changing my behavior isn&rsquo;t stopping me from updating my beliefs, but makes updating my beliefs harder, makes it a grief. that again I will be a stranger to the person I just started to develop. The person I just started to love. myself.</p>
<p>This leads me to the question about how healthy it is to constantly updating my beliefs? is the reason that i don&rsquo;t have foundational pillars to relay on, is the constant exposure to stimulating events expect me to have rules like principles of logical fallacies and that i don&rsquo;t need to update my belief? so far&hellip; I have no clue.</p>
