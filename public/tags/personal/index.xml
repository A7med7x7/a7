      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a friend I met online who struggled with social anxiety. He used to tell me how he panicked at the idea of going to the university. I knew he wasn’t lying, but part of me couldn’t truly believe it, that a psychological disorder could control someone that much. I was telling him: you just needed to stop overthinking that people will hurt you, remind yourself there’s no reason to be afraid, and call it a day. Yes, I was ignorant. I tried to convince him to change something he couldn’t change, to “overcome it,” as if these were only voices in his head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;do things badly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the years pass by, I find myself adapting to different reasons to keep living, and to share, I&amp;rsquo;m not as clear as I used to be about why I should be posting something publicly, but looking back over the years, I recall how writing started. How reasons changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Im Sharing Notes - Regret</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main incentives behind sharing my notes in public is not the urge to talk. As social creatures, we naturally love sharing experiences, stories, and ideas. But I buried that essential human feature for a long time. I used to post on &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/ahmed.alghali.524/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, not consistently, and then I went through what I called &lt;em&gt;“&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HxlPv0xI1qg?si=Zdq8THc9kZqxmiQo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Manulasis&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;”&lt;/em&gt;(I heard of this back in high school in one of the articles but I forget the spelling/word but never the definition): the tendency to give up explaining things to people. I essentially gave up sharing altogether. I became detached from the external world without even noticing, day by day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m Sharing Notes — Learned Too Late</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an anecdote about Richard Feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on Mr Feynman desk and makes a comment about these being a record of Feynman&amp;rsquo;s thinking and then Mr Feynman corrects the historian and says that: these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you&amp;rsquo;re thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that&amp;rsquo;s when Mr Feynman says:  no they aren&amp;rsquo;t a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
