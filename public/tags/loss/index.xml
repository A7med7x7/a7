      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, I had to catch up with a team I’m part of. we wanted to escape the dull rhythm of formal meetings and genuinely check in on how everyone had lived through 2025.I asked a simple question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you had to sum up your entire year in five words, what would they be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed listening to everyone, some pretty interesting answers where there, until they flipped the table on me. I had two minutes. I had never truly reflected on the year before, so what came out surprised even me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These were the five words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
