      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;your growth is directly proportional to the amount of truth you are willing to accept about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fail to know what to do when I discover something about myself that requires me to change, when I unveil an insecurity, how am I supposed to look at myself? And what should I do to the people who were affected and hurt because of me, controlled by something I had no words to describe, I had no sign of its existence? It is never easy to engage in an internal dialog with yourself discovering an insecurity that you have never thought about, and admitting its existence. I&amp;rsquo;m not very afraid but also not very comfortable to show my vulnerabilities. Today I came across a quote that perfectly describes the person I’m in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
