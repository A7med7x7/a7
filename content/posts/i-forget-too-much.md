> you're just forgetful.


There is one attribute that almost all people around me do seem to know about, because I keep talking about it a lot; it's that I find it difficult to remember both people and places, I forget things very easily, I've never investigated up until I was 18 why, why it was easy to forget moments, people and places looking back into my life trying to remember some of these moments when someone reminds me with, I see those large periods that are just black, like they were just wiped away from my memory, mostly void, sometimes they are on the edge, if I wasn't remembered by someone or something at that stage of my life I would have never remember them.

I remember my high school was very unpleasing experience to me, as soon as I finished my high school I forgot the places, the stories, the details and the people, one day in 2022 I was going back from the University passing by my High school, although I pass through it everyday, but it was the first to stop and think about it, I don't recall the exact reason why, but it was the first year in the university and just realizing again how fast I've forgot about that period of time, I don't have exact memories, I'm not able to feel something about it again, , I don't remember the experience at all, I don't remember the stories and the kind of conversations I held, I even asked Esraa Jalal my colleague who use to accompany me back to home, since we were almost neighbors,  do you remember anything from your high school experience, and she seemed to remember every single detail, it wasn't because the experience was joyful for her while to me it was unpleasing, she even remembers the hard times, and since I know her, I knew that it was a difficult period in her life and I could even tell it was worst for her than the one I had, but she seemed to remember it, I thought maybe this is gender skills issues, men tend to forget things easily and women are full of emotions so they keep it alway, although that might hold true at the time, but I found out that my male friends were not as bad as me in remembering previous experiences, wether it was high school, or whatever, I lived my life easily and have never paid attention to this.  

To this very day I don't know the exact reason, and whether the hypothesis I do have are true from false.
