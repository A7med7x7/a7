Out of boredom, I was cleaning my contacts, renaming, deleting, reorganizing. I probably should be responding to people instead, but that also feels like work, lol. While scrolling through, I found the contact of this guy who helped me for several days to get my driver’s license. I barely remember his face or his name, but I remember how genuinely helpful he was. he’s Waqas’s cousin our neighbor. I haven’t remembered either of them since the war started, maybe even from before.

This happens a lot. High school was full of memories, and almost everyone knew me back then, yet I can’t recall much. The same goes for basic school. And I don’t think that’s normal. I forget parts of my life so easily. Is it because it’s easy for me to let go? or because those moments didn’t matter in the first place? so far, I don’t know.
