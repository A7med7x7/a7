The numerous differed stories that act as catalysts for returning to God and thinking about the existence of a grand designer, creator shared by people across the globe is interesting.

<!--more--> 

There are variety of patterns often the most interesting ones are the ones concluded through Epistemic Rationality and not convenience or bias, where there was an evidence that God existed, for them.
One pattern is how God existed in everyday life. A good example is the historical belief that the creation of all temples and religions around the world throughout history is an innate, lowkey, subtle need for God.

And this is what I’m interested to pull strings out of and build upon what I felt right before I sleep.
I’m not diving into theology, but rather sharing a concept I just coined — “Gratitude Register.” This is what I assume as the “where I find God” in my “everyday life pattern.” No matter what beliefs I’m holding or how religious/spiritual I am at a particular point of time. At the end of the day (literally) I find myself accounting for what was good today and in my life. This happens by default; it’s the way your psyche validates the day, your memory works, and you yourself trying to make sense of all the nonsense you were doing throughout the day. Depending on how I define good (which of course includes biased beliefs/definitions from religion) I can bring different combinations of them. Now these things, if they outweigh the misfortunes I have, that means it is a good day (again there is no agreed upon way for defining and measuring the misfortunes) and hence some positive feelings may start to happen — one that dances sooo loud is “gratitude.” This dude is a well known visitor outshining everyone else by their urge feeling.

**Gratitude:** “I’m here.”
*Translation:* I’m grateful.
**Gratitude:** “I need to make decision so fast (urge).”
*Translation:* I need to be grateful “for someone.”

*Translation is what the mind tells about the chemicals.*

This urge and the little space I get to make the decision to fill with someone is what makes gratitude a special “positive feeling.”
This is how I translate it once to know God, and I’m feeling it everyday. To know this gratitude register (just like how a CPU register is filled faster and the need for the CPU to assign the value to some process) needs some allocation.

If it happens and if I’m full-time atheist (I don’t wish that for anyone), I believe this interaction, of validating my day and unconsciously inviting “gratitude” as a result of just me being human — shall rescue me from muddle and may guide me to the light. This is a piece of my honest truthful analysis of my feeling with gratitude.

Unclear or suggested revisions:
- "Everyone is atheist until the plane start falling" → should be "starts falling."
- Consider rephrasing: "The numerous differed stories" → perhaps "The numerous different stories."
- "where there was an evidence" → "where there was evidence."
- "sooo loud" might be too casual for a written post; consider reducing emphasis.
- Clarify: "This dude is a well known visitor outshining everyone else by their urge feeling." → could be simplified for clarity.
- Suggest making the CPU analogy more explicit: what is being "allocated" exactly? mental space? emotional attention?

Overall recommendations:
- The philosophical tone is deep and personal — consider light editing for flow and coherence without losing authenticity.
- Add paragraph breaks to improve readability.
- You might want to expand slightly on what the "Gratitude Register" means in practice — is it journaling, reflection, or a mindset?
